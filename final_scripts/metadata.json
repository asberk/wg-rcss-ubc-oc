Others of the questions, although of more modern date, incidents of our late\nCivil War, were all the more irritating, as being fresh\nwounds to the sensibility of the people of the United\nStates.\nIf, to all these considerations, be added the fact that\nnegotiation after negotiation respecting these questions had failed to resolve them in a satisfactory\nmanner, it will be readily seen how great was the\ndiplomatic triumph achieved by the Treaty of Washington.\nIt required peculiar inducements and agencies to\naccomplish this great result.\nProminent among the inducements were the pacific\nspirit of the President of .the United States and the\nQueen of Great Britain, and of their respective Cabinets, and the sincere and heartfelt desire of a great\nmajority of the people of both countries that no\nshadow of offense shduld be allowed any longer to\nlinger on the face of their international relations.\nGreat Britain, it is but just to her to say, if not confessedly conscious of wrong, yet, as being the party to\nwhom wrong was imputed, did honorably and wisely\nmake the decisive advance toward reconciliation, by\nconsenting to dispatch five Commissioners to Washington, there, under the eye of the President, to treat\nwith five Commissioners on behalf of the United\nStates.\nDiplomatic congresses have assembled on previous\noccasions to terminate the great wars of Europe, or INTRODUCTION. H\nto maintain and consolidate peace in America. And\nconferences, like those of Vienna, of Aix-la-Chapelle,\nof Paris, may have embraced the representation and\nsettled the interests of a larger number of nations; but\nthey did not consist of higher personages, nor did\nthey treat of larger matters than did the conference\nof Washington.\nOn the part of the United States were five persons,\n\u2014Hamilton Fish, Robert C. Schenck, Samuel Nelson,\nEbenezer Rockwood Hoar, and George H.Williams,\u2014\neminently fit representatives of the diplomacy, the\nbench, the bar, and the legislature of the United\nStates: on the part of Great Britain, Earl De Grey\nand Ripon, President of the Queen's Council; Sir Stafford Northcote, ex-Minister and actual Member of the\nHouse of Commons; Sir Edward Thornton, the universally respected British Minister at Washington;\nSir John Macdonald, the able and eloquent Premier of\nthe Canadian Dominion; and, in revival of the good\nold time, when learning was equal to any other title\nof public honor, the Universities in the person of\nProfessor Mountague Bernard.\nWith persons of such distinction and character, it\nwas morally, impossible that the negotiation should\nfail: the negotiators were hound to succeed. Their\nreputations, not less than the honor of their respective\ncountries, were at stake. The circumstances involved\nmoral coercion, more potent than physical force. The\nissues of peace and of war were in the hands of those\nten personages. They were to illustrate the eternal\ntruth that, out of the differences of nations, competent 12\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nstatesmen evolve peace; and that it is only by the\nincompetency of statesmen of one side or the other,\u2014\nthat is, their ignorance, their passion, their prejudice,\ntheir want of forecast, or their willfully aggressive\nambition,\u2014that the unspeakable calamities of war are\never thrust on the suffering world. Neither Mr. Fish\nnor Earl De Grey, nor their respective associates,\ncould afford to take on their consciences the responsibility, or on their characters the shame, of the non-\nsuccess on this occasion of a last effort to renovate\nand re-establish in perpetuity relations of cordial\nfriendship between Great Britain and the United\nStates. And, if they needed other impulse to right\nconclusion, that was given by the wise and firm direction of the President, here in person, and of the Queen,\nhere in effect through the means of daily telegraphic\ncommunication.\nHappily for the peace of the two countries and for\nthe welfare of the world, the negotiators proved equal\nto the emergency, in courage as well as in statesmanship. The Government and the people of Great Britain had learned to regret sincerely the occurrence of\nthe acts or facts which had given such deep offense,\nand which had done such serious injury, to the United\nStates; and, moreover, the Government and people of*\nthis country had come to desire, with equal sincerity,\nthat some honorable solution of the existing difficulties might be found, so as to leave room for the unobstructed action here of the prevailing natural tendency toward unreserved intellectual and commercial\nassociation with Great Britain.   Material interests. INTRODUCTION.\n13\nsocial sentiments, incidental circumstances, all invited\nboth nations to cordial reunion.\nIn the face of many difficulties, the Commissioners,\non the 8th of May, 1871, completed a treaty, which\nreceived the prompt approval of their respective\nGovernments; which has passed unscathed through\nthe severest ordeal of a temporary misunderstanding\nbetween the two Governments respecting the construction of some of its provisions; which has already\nattained the dignity of a monumental act in t*he estimation of mankind; and which is destined to occupy\nhereafter a lofty place in the history of the diplomacy\nand the international jurisprudence of Europe and\nAmerica.\nComing now to the analysis of this treaty, we find\nthat Articles I. to XI. inclusive make provisions for\nthe settlement by arbitration of thev injuries alleged\nto have been suffered by the United States in consequence of the fitting out, arming, or equipping, in the\nports of Great Britain, of Confederate cruisers to\nmake war on the United States.\nArticles XH to XVII. inclusive make provision to\nsettle, by means of a mixed Commission, all claims on\neither side for injuries by either Government to the citizens of the other during the late Civil War, other than\nclaims growing out of the acts of Confederate cruisers\ndisposed of by the previous articles of the Treaty.\nArticles XVIH. to XXV. inclusive contain provisions for the permanent regulation of the coast fisheries on the Atlantic shores of the United States and\nof the British Provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, and 14\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nNew Brunswick, and the Colony of Prince Edward's\nIsland [including the Colony of Newfoundland by\nArticle XXXn.].\nArticles XXVI. to XXXIH. inclusive provide for\nthe reciprocal free navigation of certain rivers, including the River St. Lawrence; for the common use of\ncertain canals in the Canadian Dominion and in the\nUnited States; for the free navigation of Lake Michigan; for reciprocal free transit across the territory\neither of the United States or of the Canadian Dominion, as the case may be: the whole, subject to\nlegislative provisions hereafter to be enacted by the\nseveral Governments.\n\u25ba Articles XXXIV. to XLH. provide for determining\nby arbitration which of two different channels between Vancouver's Island and the main-land constitutes the true boundary-line in that region of the\nterritories of the United States and Great Britain.\nEach of these five distinct classes of questions will\nreceive separate consideration. ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n15\nCHAPTER n.\nALABAMA CLAIMS.\nCONDUCT OF GREAT BRITAIN TOWARD THE UNITED STATES\nDURING THE LATE CIVIL WAR.\nAt the conclusion of the Civil War, intense feeling\nof indignation against Greajb Britain pervaded the\nminds of the Government and Congress of the United\nStates, and of the people of those of the States which\nhad devoted themselves to maintaining in arms the\nintegrity of the Union against the hostile efforts of\nthe Southern Confederation.\nWe charged and we believed that Great Britain\nand her Colonies had been the arsenal, the navy-yard,\nand the treasury of the Confederates.\nWe charged and we believed that Confederate\ncruisers, which had depredated largely on our shipping and maritime commerce, never could have taken\nand never held the sea, but for the partiality and\ngross negligence of the British Government.\nWe charged and we believed that but for the premature recognition of the belligerence of the Confederates by Great Britain, and the direct aid or supplies which were subsequently furnished to them in\nBritish ports, the insurrection in the Southern States\nnever would have assumed, or could not have retained, 16\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthose gigantic proportions, which served to render it\nso costly of blood and of treasure to the whole Union,\nand so specially disastrous to the Southern States\nthemselves.\nWe charged and we believed that, in all this, Great\nBritain, through her Government, had disregarded\nthe obligations of neutrality imposed on her by the\nlaw of nations to such manifest degree as to have afforded to the United States just and ample cause of\nwar.\nThe United States, through all these events, with\nWilliam H. Seward, as Secretary of State, and Charles\nFrancis Adams, Minister at London, had not failed to\naddress continual remonstrances to the British Government, demanding reparation for past wrong and\nthe cessation from continuous wrong: which remonstrances did, in fact, at length awaken the British\nGovernment to greater vigilance in the discharge of\nits international duties, but could not induce it to\ntake any step toward reparation so long as Earl Russell [then Lord John Russell], by whose negligence or\nmisjudgment the injuries had happened, remained in\ncharge of the foreign affairs of the Government. That\nstatesman, while, on more than one occasion, expressly\nadmitting the wrong done to the United States, still\npersisted, with singular obtuseness or narrowness of\nmind, in maintaining that the Tumor of England would\nnot permit her to make any reparation to the United\nStates.-\nNever, in the history of nations, has an occasion existed where a powerful people, smarting under the ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n17\nconsciousness of injury, manifested greater magnanimity than was displayed in that emergency by, the\nUnited States.\nWe had on the sea hundreds of ships of war or of\ntransport; we had on land hundreds of thousands of\nveteran soldiers under arms; we had officers of land\nand sea, the combatants in a hundred battles: all this\nvast force of war was in a condition to be launched\nas a thunderbolt at any enemy; and, in the present\ncase, the possessions of that enemy, whether continental or insular, lay at our very door in tempting\nhelplessness.\nBut neither the Government and people of the\nUnited States, nay, nor their laurel-crowned Generals and Admirals, desired war as a choice, nor would\naccept it but as a necessity; and they elected to continue to negotiate with Great Britain, and to do*what\nno great European State has ever done under like circumstances,\u2014that is, to disarm absolutely, and make\nthorough trial of the experiment of generous forbearance before having recourse to the dread extremity\nof vengeful hostilities against Great Britain.\nNEGOTIATIONS BY MR. SEWARD.\nThe event justified our conduct. To the prejudiced\nand impracticable Lord Russell, there succeeded in\ncharge of the foreign affairs of the British Govern-\nment, first, Lord Stanley* [now the Earl of Derby],\nand then the Earl of Clarendon, who, more wise and\njust than he, successively entered upon negotiations\nwith the United States on that very basis of arbitral\nB 18\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ntion which he had so peremptorily rejected, but which\nMr. Seward persisted in asserting as wise in itself and\nhonorable to both Governments.\nThose negotiations failed. But the rejection by\nthe Senate of the Clarendon-Johnson Treaty, with\nMr. Sumner's commentary thereon, if it had the apparent effect, at first, of widening the breach between\nthe two countries by the irritation it produced in England, yet ultimately had the opposite effect by forcing on public attention there a more general and\nclearer perception of the wrong \"which had been done\nto the United States.\nPOLICY  OF PRESIDENT GRANT.\nAt this stage of the question, President Grant came\ninto office; and he and his advisers seem to have well\njudge'd that it sufficed for him, after giving expression fully and distinctly to his own view of the\nquestions at issue, there to pause and wait for the\ntranquillization of opinion.in England; and the probable initiation of new negotiations by the British\nGovernment.\nIt happened as the President anticipated, and with\nattendant circumstances of peculiar interest to the\nUnited States.\nDuring the late war between Germany and France,\nthe condition of Europe was such as to induce the\nBritish Ministers to take into consideration the foreign relations of Great Britain; and, as Lord Granville, the British-Minister of Foreign Affairs, has him-\nself stated in the House of Lords, they saw cause to ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n19\nlook with solicitude on the uneasy relations of the\nBritish Government with the United States, and the\ninconvenience thereof in case of possible complications in Europe. Thus impelled, the Government\ndispatched to Washington a gentleman, who enjoyed\nthe confidence of both Cabinets, Sir John Rose, to ascertain whether overtures for re-opening negotiations\nwould be' received by the President in spirit and\nterms acceptable to Great Britain.\nIt was the second time, in the present generation,\nthat the foreign policy of England had been directed\nby a sense of the importance to her of maintaining\ngood relations with the United States; for, by arguing from that point, France, at the opening of war\nwith Prussia, induced-the British Government to desist from those excessive belligerent pretensions to\nthe prejudice of neutrals, which in former times had\nserved to embroil her with both France and the United States.\nThere is another fact, which, in my opinion, powerfully contributed to induce this overture on the part\nof the British Government, although it was not spoken of in this connection by Lord Granville. I allude\nto the President's recommendation to Congress to appoint a commission to audit the claims of American\ncitizens on Great Britain growing out of the.\" acts of\nConfederate cruisers, in view of having them assumed\nby the Government of the United States. ' In this incident there was matter of grave and serious reflection\nto Great Britain.\nOn arriving at Washington, Sir John Rose found F7\n20\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthe United States disposed to meet with perfect correspondence of good-will the advances of the British\nGovernment^\nOVERTURES BY  GREAT BRITAIN-\nAccordingly, on the 26th of January, 1871, the\nBritish Government, through Sir Edward Thornton,\nformally proposed to the American Government the\nappointment of a joint High Commission to hold its\nsessions at Washington, and there devise means to\nsettle the various pending questions between the two\nGovernments affecting the British possessions in\nNorth America.\nTo this overture Mr. Fish replied that the President\nwould with pleasure appoint, as invited, Commissioners on the part of the United States, provided the deliberations of the Commissioners should be extended\nto other differences,\u2014that is to say, to include the differences growing out of incidents of the late Civil\nWar: without which, in his opinion, the proposed\nCommission would fail to establish those permanent\nrelations of sincere and substantial friendship between\nthe two countries which he, in common with the\nQueen, desired to have prevail.\nThe British Government promptly accepted this\nproposal for enlarging the sphere of the negotiation,\nwith the result, as we have already seen, of the conclusion of the Treaty of Washington. ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n21\nSTIPULATIONS RESPECTING THE ALABAMA CLAIMS.\nThe Treaty begins by describing the differences,\nwhich we are now considering, as differences \" growing out of the acts committed by the several vessels,\nwhich have given rise to the claims generically known\nas the Alabama Claims;\" which are further described .as \" all the said claims growing out of acts\ncommitted by the aforesaid vessels, and generically\nknown as the Alabama. Claims.\"\nNote that the subject of difference is stated in terms\nof absolute, although specific, universality, as all the\nclaims on the part of the United States growing out\nof the acts of certain vessels. No exception is made\nof any particular claims growing out of those acts.\nAnd reference is not made to certain admitted claims\nby the British Government: on the contrary, it is expressly declared in the Treaty that the \" complaints\"\nand \" claims\" of the United States, without any discrimination between them, \" are not admitted by the\nBritish Government.\"\nAt the same time, the British Commissioners, by\nauthority of the Queen, express, \" in a friendly spirit,\nthe regret felt by Her Majesty's Government for the\nescape, under whatever circumstances, of the Alabama\nand other vessels from British ports, and for the depredations committed by those vessels.\"\nWhereupon, \" in order to remove and adjust all\ncomplaints and claims on the part of the United\nStates, and to provide for the speedy settlement of\nsuch claims\nthe contracting\nj parties agree that all 92\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthe said claims, growing out of acts committed by the\naforesaid vessels, and generically known as the Alabama Claims, shall be referred to a Tribunal of Arbitration to be composed of five Arbitrators, appointed in the following manner,\u2014namely, one by the President of the United States, and one by the Queen of\nthe United Kingdom, with request to the King of\nItaly, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and\nthe Emperor of Brazil, each to name an Arbitrator;\nand, on the omission of either of those personages to\nact, then with a like request to the King of Sweden\nand Norway.\nThe Treaty further provides that the Arbitrators\nshall meet at Geneva, in Switzerland, at the earliest\nconvenient day after they shall have been named, and\nshall proceed impartially and carefully to examine\nand decide all questions which shall be laid before\nthem on the part of either Government.\nIn deciding the matters submitted to the Arbitrators, it is provided that they shall be governed by\ncertain rules, which are agreed upon by the parties as\nrules to be taken as applicable to the case, and by\nsuch principles of international law, not inconsistent\ntherewith, as the Arbitrators shall determine to have\nbeen applicable to the case, which rules are as follows:\n\" A neutral Government is bound\u2014\n\" First, to use due diligence to prevent the fitting out, arming, or equipping, within its jurisdiction, of any vessel which it\nhas reasonable ground to believe is intended to cruise or to\ncarry on war against a Power with which it is at peace;

but, in order to evince her desire of\nstrengthening the friendly relations between the two\ncountries, and of making satisfactory provision for the\nfuture, she agrees that, in deciding the questions arising out of such claims, the Arbitrators should assume\nthat she had'undertaken to act upon the principles\nset forth in these rules.\nAnd the.Parties proceed to stipulate to observe\nthese rules as between themselves in the future, and\nto bring them to the knowledge of other maritime\nPowers, and to invite the latter to accede thereto.\nIn respect of procedure, the Treaty provides that\neach of the two Parties shall name one person to attend the Tribunal as its agent or representative;\nthat the written or printed case of each of the two\nParties, accompanied by the documents, the official\ncorrespondence, and other evidence on which each\nrelies, shall be delivered in duplicate to each of th#\njr 24 THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nArbitrators and to the agent of the other Party, as\nsoon as may be after the organization of the Tribunal; that within four months after the delivery on\nboth sides of the written or printed case, either Party\nmay, in like manner, deliver in duplicate to each of\nthe said Arbitrators and to the agent of the other\nParty a counter-case, and additional documents, correspondence, and evidence, in reply to the case, documents, correspondence, and evidence so presented by\nthe other' Party; that it shall be the duty of the\nagent of each Party, within two months after the ex-\npiration of the time limited for the delivery of the\ncounter-case on both sides, to deliver in duplicate to\neach of the said Arbitrators and to the agent of the\nother Party a written or printed argument showing\nthe points and referring to the Evidence upon which\nhis Government relies.\nNo express provision for the appointment of counsel appears in the Treaty; but they are recognized\nin the clause which declares that the Arbitrators\nmay, if they desire further elucidation with regard\nto any point, require a written or printed statement or argument, or oral argument, by counsel upon\nit; but in such case the other Party shall be entitled to reply either orally or in writing, as the case\nmay be.\nFinally, with reference to procedure, it is stipulated that the Tribunal shall first determine as to\neach vessel separately, whether Great Britain has, by\nany act or omission, failed to fulfill any of the duties\nset forth in the Treaty rules, or recognized by the ALABAMA CLAIMS.\nprinciples of international law not inconsistent with\nsuch rules, and shall certify such fact as to each of\nthe said vessels. This decision shall, if possible, be\nreached within three months from the close of the\nargument on both sides.-\nIn case the Tribunal finds that Great Britain has\nfailed to fulfill any duty or duties as aforesaid, it may,\nif it think proper, proceed to award a sum in gross\nto be paid by Great Britain to the United States for\nall the claims referred to it; and in such case the\ngross sum so awarded shall be paid in coin by the\nGovernment of Great Britain to the Government of\nthe United States, at Washington, within twelve\nmonths after the date of the award.\nIn case the Tribunal finds that Great Britain has\nfailed to fulfill any duty or duties as aforesaid, and\ndoes not award a sum in gross, the Parties agree that\na Board of Assessors shall be appointed to ascertain\nand determine what claims are valid, and what\namount or amounts shall be paid by Great Britain\nto the United States on account of the liability arising from such failure, as to each vessel, according to\nthe extent of such liability as decided by the Arbitrators. This Board to be constituted as follows:\nOne member thereof to be named by the United\nStates, one by Great Britain, and one by the Representative at Washington of the King of Italy.\nIn conclusion, the Parties engage to consider the\nresult of the proceedings of the Tribunal of Arbitration and of the Board of Assessors, should such\nBoard be appointed, | as a full, perfect, and final set- i\n26\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ntlement of all the claims\" in question; and further\nengage that \" every such claim, whether the same\nmay I or may not have been presented to the notice\nof, made, preferred, or laid before the Tribunal or\nBoard, shall, from and after the conclusion of the\nproceedings of the Tribunal or Board, be considered\nand treated as finally settled, barred, and thenceforth,\ninadmissible.\"\nARRANGEMENTS OF ARBITRATION.\nThe appointment of Arbitrators took place in due\ncourse, and with the ready good-will of the three neutral Governments. The United States appointed Mr.\nCharles Francis Adams; Great Britain appointed Sir\nAlexander Cockburn; the King of Italy named Count\nFrederic Sclopis; the President of the Swiss Confederation, Mr. Jacob Stsempfli; and the Emperor of\nBrazil, the Baron d'ltajuba.\nMr. J. C. Bancroft Davis was appointed Agent of\nthe United States, and Lord Tenterden of Great\nBritain.\nThe Tribunal was organized for the reception of\nthe case of each Party, and held its first conference on\nthe.'15th of December, 1871.\nOn the motion of Mr.' Adams, seconded by Sir\nAlexander Cockburn, it was voted that Count Sclopis,\nas being the Arbitrator named by the first Power\nmentioned in the Treaty after Great Britain and the\nUnited States, should preside over the labors of the\nTribunal.\nI observe in passing, as will be more distinctly seen ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n27\nhereafter, that the personal fitness of Count Sclopis\nalso rendered it eminently proper that he should preside ; for he was the senior in age of all the Arbitrators, of exalted social condition, and distinguished as\na man of letters, a jurist, and a statesman.\nOn the proposal of Count Sclopis, the Tribunal of\nArbitration requested the Arbitrator named by the\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation to recommend\nsome suitable person to act as the Secretary of the\nTribunal. Mr. Stsempfli named for this office Mr.\nAlexandre Favrot, and he was accordingly appointed\nSecretary.\nThe printed Case of the United States, with accompanying documents, was filed by Mr. Bancroft Davis,\nand the printed Case of Great Britain, with documents, by Lord Tenterden.\nThe Tribunal made regulation for the filing of the\nrespective Counter-Cases on or before the 15th day of\nApril next ensuing, as required by the Treaty; and\nfor the convening of a special meeting of the Tribunal, if occasion should require; and then, at a second\nmeeting, on the next.day, they adjourned until the\n15th of June next ensuing, subject to a prior call by\nthe Secretary, if there should be occasion, as provided\nfor in the proceedings at the first Conference.\nThe record of these, and of all the subsequent Conferences of the Tribunal, is contained in alternate Protocols, drawn up both in French and in English, verified by the signatures of the President and Secretary,\nand of the agents of the two Governments.\nIn these opening proceedings, that is, at the very 28\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nearliest moment possible, signs became visible of\nthe singular want of discretion and good sense of\nthe \" enfant terrible,\" ostentatiously protocoled \" Lord\nChief Justice of England \" whom the British Govern-\nment had placed on the Tribunal.\nThe vernacular tongue of Count Sclopis was Italian ; that of the Baron d'ltajuba, Portuguese; and\nthat of Mr. Stsempfli, German. Count Sclopis spoke\nand read English, and Mr. Stsempfli read it. All the\nArbitrators, however, were well acquainted with\nFrench; and it was in this language that they com-\nmumcated with one another, whether in social intercourse or in the discussions of the Tribunal. Thus,\nwe had before iis a Tribunal, the members of which\ndid not either of them make use of his own language\nin their common business; but met, all of them, on\nthe neutral ground of the common diplomatic language of Europe.\nIn this connection it was that the United States\nenjoyed their first advantage. Our Government did\nnot need to wait until the organization of the Tribunal to know in what language its proceedings would\nbe conducted; and, in prevision of this fact, it ordered\nthe American \"Case\" to be translated from the English into French, so as to be presented simultaneously in both languages at the meeting of the Tribunal: the exigency for which was not anticipated,\nor, if anticipated, was not provided for, by the British Government.\nThe American \" Case \" and documents are contain*\ned in eight volumes octavo, which consist in all of ALABAMA CLALMS.\n29\n5442 pages, as reduced to a common standard, that of\nthe printing by Congress.\nThe British \" Case \" and documents fill, in the reprint by Congress, three volumes octavo, consisting of\n2823 pages.\nPerusal of the American and British Cases, and of\ntheir accompanying documents on both sides, brings\nus to consideration of the peculiarities in the course\nof argument and trial prescribed by the Treaty.\nIn effect, the United States were the plaintiffs, and\n*Great Britain the defendant, in a suit at law, to be\ntried, it is true, before a special tribunal, and determined by conventional rules, but not the less a suit\nat law for the recovery of damages in reparation of\nalleged injuries.\nIn common course, the plaintiff's counsel would\nopen his case and put in his evidence; the defendant's\ncounsel would then open the defense and put in defensive proofs; and, after ihe close of the testimony\non both sides, the defendant's counsel would argue in\nclose for the defense, and then the plaintiff's counsel\nin -final close for the plaintiff.\nHere, on the contrary, the defendant's opening argument and defensive proofs went in at the same time\nas the plaintiff's opening argument and proofs, each\nunder the name of the \"Case\" of the respective Party.\nThe British Case, of course, could not answer the\nAmerican Case, save by conjecture and anticipation\nfounded on common knowledge of the subject-matter.\nThe respective Counter-Cases of the Parties were\nto go in together, in like manner, in April, and their 30\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nrespective Arguments in June: so that the Counter-\nCases would on each side be response to the previous\nCases, and the Arguments to the previous Counter-\nCases.\nThis course of presentation was in no sort prejudicial to the United States, as plaintiffs, and was exceedingly advantageous to Great Britain, as defendant.\nTHE AMERICAN  CASE.\n' Nevertheless, when our \" Case \" went in,\u2014that is to\nsay, the opening argument for the United States,\u2014its*\ntrue character as such was misapprehended in England, where it seemed to be forgotten that the time\nand place for replying to it were in the British Counter-Case, and not in the newspapers of London or in\nthe British Parliament.\nSimilar misconception occurred subsequently with\nregard to the American Argument; the Counsel for\nGreat Britain thinking that he ought to have the op-\nportunity of replying, as will be explained hereafter,\nand losing sight of the fact that the British Govern-\nment had already argued the matter three times in\n\" Case,\" \" Counter-Case,\" and \" Argument.\"\nAs to the American Case, it seemed to fall into the\nadversary's camp like a bomb-shell, which rendered\neveiy body dumb for a month, and then produced\nan explosion of clamor, which did not cease for three\nor four months, and until the final decision of the\nTribunal of Arbitration.\nThe leading journals of England, whether daily or\nweekly, such as the London Times, Telegraph, and ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n31\nNews, the Saturday Review, the Spectator, the Pall\nMall Gazette, the Manchester Guardian, and other\nBritish journals generally, are certainly conducted\nwith great ability, and are second, in character and in\nvalue, to no others in Europe. In view of which it\nmust be confessed that the outcry which they made\nagainst the American Case seemed to me.at the time\nto be altogether unworthy of them and of England.\nIt was my opinion on reading the American Case\nfor the first time, and is my opinion now, after repeated readings, that it is not only a document of\nsignal ability, learning, and forensic force,\u2014which, indeed, every body admits,-\u2014but that it is also temperate in language and dignified in spirit, as becomes\nany state paper which is issued in the name of the\nUnited States.\nI do not mean to say that it is so.cold a document\nas the British Case. Warmth or coldness of color is a\nmatter of taste, in respect of which the United States\nhave no call to criticise Great Britain, and Great Britain has no right to criticise the United States.\nWe may presume that, in the exercise of its unquestionable right, the Government of the United\nStates made up its Case in the aim of convincing the\nArbitrators, and not with any dominant purpose or\nspecial expectation of pleasing Great Britain.\nBut there is no just cause of exception to the general tenor, spirit, or style of the American Case. Its\nfacts are pertinent; its reasonings are cogent; its conclusions are logical: and in all that is the true ex-\nplanation of the emotion it occasioned in England. 32\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nIntelligent people there, on reading the American\nCase, then opened their eyes universally to the fact\nthat Great Britain was about to be tried before-a high\ncourt constituted by three neutral Governments.\nThat was not an agreeable subject of reflection. Intelligent Englishmen also, on reading the American\nCase, began to be uneasily conscious of the strength\nof the cause of the United States. And that was not\nan agreeable subject of reflection. For a good cause,\nin a good court, seemed likely to result in a great international judgment adverse to England.\nThe specific objections preferred were quite futile.\nThus, complaint was made because the Case charged\nthe British Ministers* with  unfriendliness  to  the\n9\nUnited States for a certain period of the Civil War.\nBut the charge was proved by citing the declarations\nof those Ministers; it was not, and could not be denied by any candid Englishman; it is admitted by\nSir Alexander Cockburn in the dissenting opinion\nwhich he filed at the close of the Arbitration. And\nthe charge was pertinent, because it explained the\nnegligent acts of subordinate British authorities, as\nat Liverpool or Nassau: which acts could not be\notherwise explained unless by suggesting a worse\nimputation, namely, i^hat of hostile insincerity on the\npart of the Ministers.\nIf there be any person at the present day, who is\ninclined to call in question the truth of the foregoing\nremarks, he is earnestly entreated to read the American Case now, in the light of the adjudged guilt of\nthe British Government, and he will then see ample ALABAMA CLAIMS.\noo\ncause to approve the reason, the dignity, and the temper of that Case.\nEXPLANATION OF OBJECTIONS TO THE AMERICAN CASE.\nThe truth undoubtedly is, that discontent with the\nTreaty itself had much to do in England with objections to the \" Case.\". The British Ministers had negotiated the Treaty in perfect good faith, and in well-\nfounded conviction of its wisdom, of the justice of its\nprovisions, and of its not conflicting with the honor\neither of Great Britain or of the United States. Parliament had accepted the Treaty without serious opposition, and with but little debate, except on the\nvery trivial party question whether it was more or\nless favorable to Great Britain than the conventions\nnegotiated by Lord Stanley and the Earl of Clarendon. And Gfeat Britain, as a nation, had, beyond\nall peradventure, heartily approved and welcomed\nthe conclusion of the Treaty.\nBut, on reading the American Case, and reflecting\non the constitution of the proposed Tribunal, many\nEnglishmen yielded to a sentiment of undue estimate\no\u00a3 English law and English lawyers, as distinguished\nfrom the laws and the lawyers of Continental Europe\nand of Spanish and Portuguese America. England\nhas good reason to be proud of her legal institutions\nand of her jurists, and, of late years, she has learned\nto regard the common law with some abatement of\nthat fetich/ism of devotion which was taught by Coke\nand by Fortescue. But the statesmen appointed by\nthe three neutral Governments to act as Arbitrators\nC 34.\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nat Geneva, and who, it was clearly seen, would be the\neffective judges in the cause, were not likely to share\nthe English opinion of the common law of England.\nAnd these three Arbitrators were persons outside of\nthe range of the observation, knowledge, or appreciation of most Englishmen, who felt undefined distrust\nof men whom they did not and could not know as\nthey knew Englishmen and Americans. Nay, Englishmen were heard to say, in conversation, that they\nwould prefer a tribunal made up of Englishmen and\nAmericans. We shall fully comprehend how strong\nthis sentiment was among average Englishmen, when\nwe remember that expression was given to it in the\nHouse of Lords by the Marquess of Salisbury, who,\nnotwithstanding his high intelligence, and the cos-\nmopolitan experience which men of his rank possess,\ncould characterize as unhnown, and, therefore, as objectionable, an actual Embassador in France, an ex-\nPresident of Switzerland, and a Senator and ex-Min-\nister of Italy with fame as a jurist and historian pervading Europe. It was a sentiment which Sir Alexander Cockburn betrayed in his deportment and\nlanguage at several meetings of the Tribunal.\nThese, however, were but the transitory incidents\nof popular emotion and public discussion, and of secondary significance.\nAGITATION RESPECTING THE NATIONAL CLAIMS.\nBut the agitation which soon followed, on the subject of certain of the claims set forth in the Case of\nthe United States, arose at once to national impor- ALABAMA. CLAIMS.\n35\ntance. I allude, of course, to what was frequently\nspoken of as the question of \" indirect claims.\"\nThe expression is incorrect, and, if admissible as a\npopular designation, it must not be permitted to produce any misconception of the true question at issue.\nIt would be less inaccurate to speak of them as \"claims\nfor indirect or constructive losses or damages,\" which\nis the more common phrase in. the diplomatic papers;\nand less inaccurate still to say \"remote or consequential losses and damages.\" But, in truth, none of these\nexpressions are correct, and the use of them has done\nmuch to obscure the actual point of controversy, and\nto divert the public-mind into devious paths of argument or conclusion.\nWhen, in the instructions to Mr. Motley of September 25th, 1869, President Grant caused the British\nGovernment to be informed, through the Secretary\nof State, of the nature of the grievances of the United\nStates, he employed the following language:\n\"The President is not yet prepared to pronounce on the\nquestion of the indemnities which he thinks due by Great\nBritain to individual citizens of the United States for the destruction of their property by rebel cruisers fitted out in the\nports of Great Britain. ,\n\" Nor is he now prepared to speak of the reparation which\nhe thinks due by the British Government for the larger account of the vast national injuries it has inflicted on the United\nStates.\n\" Nor does he attempt now to measure the relative effect of\nthe various causes of injury, whether by untimely recognition\nof belligerency, by suffering the fitting out of rebel cruisers, or\nby the supply of ships-, arms, and munitions of war to the Confederates, or otherwise, in whatsoever manner. 36\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\n1 Nor does it fall within the scope of this dispatch to discuss\nthe important changes in the rules of public law, the desirableness of which has been demonstrated by the incidents of the\nlast few years, now under consideration, and which, in view of\nthe maritime prominence of Great Britain and the United\nStates, it would befit them to mature and propose to the other\nStates of Christendom.\n\u2022 \"All these are subjects of future consideration, which, when\nthe time for action shall arrive, the President will consider\nwith sincere and earnest desire that all differences between\nthe two nations may be adjusted amicably and compatibly\nwith the honor of each, and to the promotion of future concord\nbetween them; to which end he will spare no effort within the\nrange of his supreme duty to the right and interests of the\nUnited States.\"\nThe British Government was in this way distinctly\nnotified that, in addition to the question of indemnities to individual citizens for the destruction of their\nproperty, the United States were entitled to reparation \" for the larger account of the vast national in-\njuries\" inflicted on them as a Government.\nThat the British Government so understood the\nmatter is proved by the tenor of the elaborate responsive paper, styled \" Observations,\" appended to Lord\nClarendon's dispatch to Sir Edward Thornton of the\nensuing November; and our national claims are specifically commented on in those \" Observations.\"\nIt is immaterial how these national losses came\nafterward to be designated by the title of constructive or indirect; yet such is the fact.\nNow, it is perfectly clear that national claims are\nnot claims for indirect or constructive loss, any more\nthan individual claims are.    In fact, throughout the ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n37\nlegal discussions before the Tribunal, the British Government steadily maintained that all the claims of individual citizens for the destruction of their vessels\nby Confederate cruisers were in the nature, of constructive, indirect, remote, and consequential injuries\nor losses, and, therefore, not recoverable in law, either\nby the rules of the common law of England or of the\ncivil law as practiced on the Continent. Nothing\ncould more clearly show the inapplicability and\nequivocation of the phrase \"indirect\" claims or losses\nto designate any of the contents of the Treaty of\nWashington.\nManifestly, while private losses are supposable\nwhich may be direct to individual citizens, national\nlosses are supposable which may be direct to the nation. On the other hand, private losses are supposable as well as national, which any jurist or any court\nwould pronounce to be indirect, remote, or consequential in their nature.\nAll the discussion on this question asserts or admits impliedly that the capture of a private merchant's vessel by a Confederate cruiser inflicted direct\nloss or damage on the citizen-proprietor. Was not\nthe loss or damage occasioned by the capture of a\nGovernment vessel equally a case of direct loss to\nthe Government ?    Most assuredly.\nPursue the inquiry one step further. If, in a war\ncarried on by land between two States, one of them\ninvades the other and devastates the territory thereof, is not that a case of direct injury to the invaded\nState f   If the hostilities in question be purely mari-\n1 38\nTHE  TREATY  OF WASHINGTON.\ntime, as in the example of the imperfect or quasi war\nbetween the United States and France in the closing\nyears of the last century, can it be denied that the\ninjuries done to either nation by such hostilities on\nthe sea involve direct national as well as private\ninjuries ?\nOn first impression, therefore, it might seem that\nthe British. Government and British opinion ran wild\nin the chase of shadows, and combated a creature of\nmere imagination in quarreling with this part of the\nAmerican Case at all, and, still more, in contending\nthat on this account Great Britain could be justified\nin revoking the arbitration agreed upon,\u2014that is, in\neffect, violating the Treaty.\nThe Treaty referred to the Tribunal of Arbitration,\nin terms unequivocal, all claims of the United States\ngrowing out of the acts committed by certain vessels,\nand generically Jcnown as \"Alabama Claims.'''' It\nmight need to go outside of the Treaty into antecedent or contemporaneous diplomatic correspondence\nin order to ascertain the meaning of the phrase \"Alabama Claims;\" but, in so doing, it would incontro-\nvertibly appear, at every stage of such correspondence, that national as well as individual claims were\ncomprehended, and were all confounded together, and,\nindeed, without mention of individual claims, in the\ndesignation of \"claims on the part of the United\nStates.\"\nWhether any of the claims so preferred on the part\nof the United States were for losses indirect or consequential would be an ordinary question of jurispru- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n39\ndence, for the decision of the Tribunal of Arbitration,\nand could not be a question affecting the integrity or\nforce of the Treaty.\nNo expression or even intimation of the question of\nI direct or indirect\" appears on the face of the Treaty.\nAnd, in the long diplomatic correspondence which\nensued on this subject, it was conclusively demonstrated by Mr. Fish, and was, in effect, admitted by\nLord Granville, that no agreement, promise, or understanding existed on the part of the Commissioners to\nqualify the clear and explicit language of the Treaty.\nCAUSE OF THIS AGITATION.\nHence we might well infer or believe that the su-\nperficial or apparent question, which so agitated people of high intelligence and practical sense like the\nEnglish, was not the real or true one. It was not.\nAnd, in order to understand the causes of the storm\nof discussion which broke over England when the\ntenor of the American Case came to be fully apprehended there, and of the real consternation which\nseemed to prevail on the subject, it is necessary to\ntake into consideration certain facts wholly independent of the American Case and the Treaty.\nOn occasion of the rejection by the United States\nof the Johnson-Clarendon Treaty, with Mr. Sumner's\nspeech as a commentary on that act, England came\ndistinctly to comprehend, what she had been frequently told before but would not believe, that the\nUnited States attributed the prolongation of our Civil War largely to her premature recognition of the 40\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nbelligerence of the Confederates, and to the conse-\nquent facility of the latter to obtain supplies; and\nalso, though less so, yet in an appreciable degree, to\nthe naval warfare which the Confederates carried on\nagainst us from the basis of operations of the ports\nof Great Britain.\nCareful perusal of the instructions to Mr. Motley\nwould have shown that the President of the United\nStates, while persisting to claim reparation for all injuries done by Confederate cruisers, whether to individuals or to the nation, did not insist on the recognition of belligerence as a continuing subject of claim\nof Great Britain.\nConscious of this distinction, while the American\nCommissioners would not relinquish claim on account\nof any thing done by Confederate cruisers, the British\nCommissioners were content with stipulations of indemnity, which covered all national claims of the last\ncategory, but did not reach back to claims on account\nof the unreasonableness and prematurity of the proclamation of the Queen.\nThat is what is meant by Mr. Bernard in his lecture at Oxford, where he speaks of the specific character of the stipulations: they were specific, confined\nto acts of the Confederate cruisers. And the point\nis clearly evolved in the debate in the House of Lords\non occasion of the presentation of the Treaty, when\nLord Russell objected that it was no better for Great\nBritain than the Johnson-Clarendon Treaty, and Lord\nGranville replied that it was better, because, while it\nincludes claims on account of acts of cruisers, it does ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n41\nnot include claims on account of the Queen's proclamation recognizing the belligerence of the Confederates.\nNevertheless, when, in England, the argument of\nthe American Case had been read and pondered,\u2014\nwhen\" it was perceived that this argument imputed to\nGreat Britain constructive complicity with the Confederates by reason of the culpable negligence of the\nBritish Government to arrest the enterprises of such\nvessels as the Alabama, the Florida, and the Shenandoah,\u2014and, finally, when it was thus understood that,\nin preferring claim for all the loss or injury growing\nout of the acts of those cruisers, whether to the Government or to private citizens, the United States did,\nin express terms as well as in legal intendment, hold\nthe British Government responsible for prolongation\nof our Civil War and the cost of its prosecution,\u2014\nwhen all these relations of the subject came to be understood, the public mind in England, and especially\nthe commercial mind, recurred at once to the event\nwhich constituted at the time the dominant pre-occu-\npation of Europe, namely, the war indemnity of six\nmilliards so recently imposed by Germany on France.\n.In view of this, a panic terror seemed to seize upon\nLondon, similar to what occasionally occurs in New\nYork and other great money centres, producing a\nstate of demonstrative emotion, which, to calm observers outside of such centres, looks like the spasmodic agitation of men who have lost their senses,\nrather than intelligent human action. Such, indeed,\nis all panic terror, as exemplified by numerous historical incidents of the contagious influence, both in\n\u00bb- 42\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\npeace and war, of the most trivial causes and the\nmost absurd illusions.\nOn the present occasion, London appears to have\nbeen shaken and tossed by the intense fear of Great\nBritain being in turn called upon to pay some indefinite milliards of war indemnity to the United States.\nDISCUSSION BETWEEN THE TWO GOVERNMENTS.\nThe British Government was very slow to take\nthis infection of popular fear and commotion. The\nAmerican Case was duly filed on the 15th of December. Many copies of it were in the hands of the\nBritish Ministers in a few days thereafter. We do\nnot hear of any particular disturbance of mind on\nthe part of the Ministers until the beginning of February, that is, the lapse of six or seven weeks, when\nthe American Minister, General Schenck, telegraphed\nto Mr. Fish as follows: \" London journals all demand\nthat the United States shall withdraw claims for indirect damages, as not within 'intention of treaty.\nMinistry alarmed? To which Mr. Fish responded\nby telegraph as follows.: \" There must be no withdrawal of any part of the claim presented. Counsel\nwill argue the case as prepared, unless they show to\nthis Government reasons for a change. The alarm\nyou speak of does not reach us. We are perfectly\ncalm and content to await the award, and do not anticipate repudiation of the Treaty by the other side.\"\nAnd in these two telegrams we have the history of\nthe whole interval of time prior to the next meeting\nof the Tribunal.    Newspapers in England lashed ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n43\nthemselves into a \"fine frenzy.\" Ministers and the\nParliament, instead of manfully taking a stand at the\noutset in opposition to the pbpular current of delusion and passion, got alarmed and lost their heads,\nand said and did some things not creditable to the\nBritish Government. In the United States, on the\nother hand, sundry persons were officiously over-zealous on the wrong side; the newspaper press was a\nlittle flustered; and some things were written and\npublished which it would have been better not to\nwrite and publish; but the public mind maintained\nits equilibrium, content, on the whole, to await the\nprogress of the arbitration : while the President, the\nSecretary of State, with his colleagues of the Cabinet,\nand the Congress, remained 1 perfectly calm,\" standing always on the stipulations of the Treaty, and\nnever believing it would be broken or disregarded\nby Great Britain.\nIn my opinion, the contrast at this time between\nthe attitude of the British Government and that of\nthe American Government deserves a few words of\ncommentary.\nIt is not uncommon in England to suppose and to\nsay that demagogy, that is, factious appeal to popular\nprejudice and passion, is a conspicuous feature of\npolitical action in the United States. It seems to\nbe supposed also that demagogy here pleases itself\nespecially with accusations of Great Britain. Meanwhile, it is complacently assumed that self-possession\nand stability, with unexceptional amiability toward\nthe United  States, characterize political action in 44\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nGreat Britain. I think the absolute reverse of all\nthis is the truth.\nIn Great Britain the political institutions of the\ncountry are indefinite, unwritten, unfixed, without a\npositive stand-point any where, shifting from' day to\nday; consisting, in form, of Kings, Lords, and Commons, without any visible lines of limitation between\nthem, and resolved to-day into an omnipotent Parliament, one branch of which, the House of Commons,\narrogates to itself the character of a constituent na-\ntional convention to impose on King and Lords any\nchange in the national institutions it sees fit, and assuming to itself the function, by means of a quasi\ncommittee of its body, to control absolutely the administration, both foreign and domestic, of Great\nBritain.\nThis quasi committee of the House of Commons,\nto be sure, has associated with it another quasi committee of the House of Lords: which, all together,\nformerly called Ministers of the Crown, now take to\nthemselves, in the very text of treaties as well as in\ndomestic affairs, the revolutionary title of the \" British Government.\"\nBut, while the theoretical power of the Crown is\nnominally exercised by a joint committee of both\nHouses of Parliament, it is vested, in fact, in the committee of the House of Commons, which, upon all occasions, whether of ordinary administrative matters\nor of the frequently recurring radical changes in the\npolitical institutions of the country, constantly and\nloudly defies and overbears the House of Lords. ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n45\nIf any simple-minded person in the United States\nhappens to cherish those romantic illusions respect-\n'ing the constitution of England which he may have\nacquired from perusal of the Commentaries of Sir\nWilliam Blackstone, he has but to turn over the\nleaves of some volume of Hansard's Debates in Parliament, or peruse authoritative disquisitions on the\nsubject, like those of May and of Bagehot, to discover\nthat, in knowledge and reading at least, he has not\nyet emerged from the mythical epoch of the political\nhistory of England.\nNow, the submergence of the power of the Crown\nin Parliament, and of that of Parliament in the House\nof Commons, and the commitment of all these powers\nto transitory nominees of the House of Commons, are\nfacts which, combined, have produced the result that\ngovernment in England is at the mercy of every gust\nof popular passion, every storm of misdirected public\nopinion, every devious impulse of demagogic agitation,\u2014nothing correspondent to which exists in the\nUnited States.\nMr. Gladstone is Prime Minister of Great Britain,\n\u2014that is to say, of three hundred millions of men, aggregated into various States of Europe, Africa, America, Asia, and Australasia. But he holds all this power at the mere will of a majority of the House of Commons. He must consult their wishes and their prejudices in every act of his political life. If he conceives a great idea, he can not make any thing of it\nuntil after he shall have driven it into the heads of\nthree or four hundred country gentlemen, which are\n*/     ZD * 46\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nnot always easily perforable either by eloquence or\nby reason. And during the progress of all great\nmeasures, including especially foreign negotiations,\nwhich require to be left undisturbed in their progress from germination to maturity, he is subject to be\ngoaded almost to madness every day by vicious interpellations, not only On the part of members of the\nOpposition, but even his own supporters in the House\nof Commons.\nHow different is the spectacle of government in\nthe United States! Here, the President,\u2014that is, the\nPrime Minister of the sovereign people,\u2014is placed in\npower for a fixed period of time, during which he is\npolitically independent of faction, and can look at the\ntemporary passions of the hour with calmness, so as\nto judge them at their true value, and accept or reject\ntheir voice according to the dictates of public duty\nand the command of his conscience. Neither he nor\nany of the members of his Cabinet are subject to be\nbadgered by factious or unreasonable personal interrogation in either house of Congress.\nMoreover, the House of Representatives does not\npresume to set itself up as the superior either of the\nPresident or of the Senate. Nor is the Senate in the\ncondition of being terrified from the discharge of its\nduty by threats on the part of the President or of the\nHouse of Representatives to subjugate ite free will at\nany moment by thrusting into it a batch of twenty\nnew administration Senators. Least of all does the\nHouse of Representatives presume to possess .and exercise the powers of a constituent national convention, ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n47\nto change in its discretion the constitution of the\nUnited States.\nThus it was that, in the matter of the discussion of\nthis Treaty, Mr. Gladstone and the other Ministers\nwere tossed to and fro on the surging waves of public opinion, and pestered from day to day in Parliament, while solicitously engaged in reflecting how\nbest to keep faith with the United States and at the\nsame time do no prejudice to Great Britain. If, at\nthat period, the Ministers said in debate any thing\nJL / \u00ab/ Cj\nunwise, any thing not strictly true or just,\u2014Mr. Gladstone did, but Lord Granville did not,\u2014let it not be\nremembered against them personally, but charged to\nthe uncontrollable difficulties of their position, and the\nsignal defectiveness and intrinsic weakness of the organic institutions of Great Britain.\nDuring all that period of earnest discussion on both\nsides of the ocean, it was to me, as an American,\nmatter of the highest thankfulness and gratulation\nand patriotic pride, to see the Government of the\nUnited States,\u2014President, Secretary of State, Cabinet,\nCongress,\u2014continue in the even tenor of their public\nduty, calm, unruffled, self-possessed, as the stars in\nheaven. The Executive of the United States is, it is\ntrue, by its very nature, a thoughtful and self-contained power. Congress, on the other hand, is the\nfield of debate and the place where popular passions\ncome into evidence, as the winds in the cave of .^Eolus.\nBut, on this occasion, no more debate occurred in\neither House than that least possible expression of\nopinion, which was necessary to show accord with the *mt\n48\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nExecutive. Even the Opposition, to its honor be it\nsaid, conducted itself with commendable reserve and\nconsideration. How different from all this was the\nspectacle exhibited by the British Parliament!\nENGLISH MISCONCEPTION OF AMERICAN SENTIMENT.\nI contradict, with equal positiveness, the suggestion\nthat demagogic agitation in the United States feeds\nitself largely on alleged hatred of Great Britain. I\nthink topics of international reproach are more common in England than here. The steady current of\nemigration from England, Scotland, and Ireland to\nthe United Stated, and especially at the present time\nfrom England, is not a grateful subject of contemplation in Great Britain. England perceives, but not\nwith perfect contentedness, that the British race in\nAmerica bids fair soon to exceed in numbers and in\npower the British race in Europe. And, above all,\nthe gradually increasing force of those factions or\nparties in Great Britain, which demand progressive\nenlargement of the basis of suffrage, equal distribution of representation, vote by ballot, the separation\nof Church and State, subdivision of the great properties in land, cessation of hereditary judicial and political power, intellectual and social elevation of the\ndisinherited classes,\u2014I say such parties or factions, in\nappealing to the institutions of the United States as\na model, provoke criticism of those institutions on the\npart of the existing depositaries of property and political power. Owing to these, and other causes which\nmight be indicated, it seems to me that the United ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n49\nStates encounter more criticism in Great Britain than\nGreat Britain does in the United States.\nMoreover, it should be borne in mind that much of\nthe inculpation of Great Britain which is perceived in\nthe United States proceeds from British immigrants,\u2014\nlargely Irish, but in part Scottish and English,\u2014who,\nlike other Europeans, are but too prone to come here\nwith all their native political prejudices clinging to\nthem; who not seldom hate the Government of their\nnative land; and who, of course, need time to cease to\nbe Europeans in spirit and to become simply Americans. And it would not be without interest in this\nrelation to see how many of such persons, in the newspaper press or elsewhere, say or do things tending to\ncause it to be supposed that opinion in the United\nStates is hostile to Great Britain.\nThere is one other class of facts which it is proper\nto state in this relation, and particularly proper for\nme to state.\nThe successful revolution of the thirteen Colonies\nwas an event most unacceptable, of course, to England.\nWe, the victors in that contest, should not murmur if\nresentful memories thereof lingered for some time in\nthe breasts of the defeated party. I think, however,\nsuch feelings have ceased to manifest themselves in\nEngland. It is to quite other causes, in my opinion,\nthat we are to attribute the successive controversies\nbetween the two countries, in which, as it seems to\nine, the greater wrong has in each case been on the\nside of England. I think we did not afford her sufficient cause of complaint for continuing in hostile oc-\nD 50\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ncupation of the Northwestern Territory for so many\nyears after we had made peace. I think she was\nwrong in issuing the notorious Orders in Council, and\nin the visitation of our ships and impressment of our\nseamen, which morally constrained us, after exhausting all other means of redress, to have recourse to\nwar. I think she was wrong in contending that that\nwar extinguished the rights of coast fishery assured\nto us by the Treaty of Independence. I think she\nwas wrong in the controversy on the subject of colonial trade, which attained so much prominence during\nthe Presidency of John Quincy Adams. I think she\nwas wrong in.attempting to set up the fictitious Mosquito Kingdom in Central America. I think she was\nwrong in the so-called San Juan Question. And so\nof other subjects of difference between the two Governments.\nNow, it has happened to me, in the course of a long\npublic life, to be called on to deal officially, either in\nCongress, in the Cabinet, or at the Bar, with many of\nthese points of controversy between the two Governments, of which it suffices to mention for example\nthree, namely: 1, the Question of British Enlistments;\n2, the Hudson's Bay Company; and 3, the Alabama\nClaims.\nIn regard to the first of these questions, the United\nStates, and the persons who administered the Government, were so clearly right that, although the British\nGovernment, in its Case, improvidently brought into\ncontroversy at Geneva, by way of counter-accusation,\nthe general conduct of the United States during the ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n51\nwar between Great Britain and Russia, and although\nwe replied by charging in response that the only violations of neutrality'committed in the United States\nduring that war were committed by Great Britain\nherself, yet in the subsequent discussions not a word\nof self-justification on this point was preferred by\nthe British Government.\nIn regard to the second of the questions, a member\nof Parliament [Mr. Hughes], in ignorance of the facts,\nit is to be presumed, undertook to impugn the conduct of the Counsel of the United States, and to draw\ninferences therefrom prejudicial to the conduct of the\nUnited States in the Arbitration at Geneva. In response to this complaint, it suffices to say that, on occasion of a settlement of the claims of the Hudson's\nBay Company and of its shadow, the Puget's Sound\nAgricultural Company, by mixed commission, under\nthe treaty of July, 1863, it devolved on me, in behalf\nof the United States, to assert, and to prove to the\nsatisfaction of the Commission, that the pretensions of\nthe Hudson's Bay Company were scandalously unjust, and founded on premises of exaggeration and\nusurpation injurious to Great Britain and to the Canadian Dominion, as well as to the United States.\nI have no reason to regret or qualify any thing said\nor done by me in that affair.\nAs to the third of these questions, namely, the Alabama Claims, it seems difficult to comprehend how\npersistent demand of redress on the part of the United\nStates can be complained of by any candid Englishman now, when the judgment of the Tribunal: of Ar> 52\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nbitration establishes the fact of the long denial of justice by Great Britain in this behalf,\u2014a fact admitted\nalso by so prejudiced a person as Sir Alexander Cockburn, who speaks as [\" in some sense \" at least] \" the\nrepresentative of Great Britain.\"\nI confidently maintain, therefore, that neither the\nBritish Government nor the people of Great Britain\nhad any just cause, in the course of these transactions,\nto find fault with the spirit, temper, or language either\nof the Government or the Agent or Counsel of the\nUnited States. To the contrary of this, it seems to\nme that on our side alone is the good cause of complaint in these respects.\nATTITUDE OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.\nAs respects the deportment of the two Governments\nin this crisis, certain it is that the conduct of that of\nGreat Britain, in resting upon the American Case for\nnearly seven weeks, and then abruptly breaking out,\nin the Queen's speech from the throne and in debate\nin Parliament, with objections to that Case, without\nprevious statement thereof in diplomatic communication, was uncourteous toward the United States.\nThe diplomatic discussion which ensued, beginning\nwith Lord Granville's -note of February 3,1872,* and\nterminating with the dispatch of Mr. Fish of April 16,\n. 1872, may now be read, not with composure only, but\nwith supreme satisfaction, by any citizen of the United\nStates. The Secretary of State [Mr. Fish] demonstrates to conviction the utter baselessness of the pretension of the British Government that the so-called ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n53\nindirect claims were not within the letter or spirit of\nthe Treaty of Washington. And he repels throughout, peremptorily but dispassionately, the call of the\nBritish Government on the United States to withdraw\nthis class of claims from the consideration of the Tribunal. In fine, the position of the United States is\nplainly expressed in different parts of the dispatches\nof Mr. Fish, as follows:\n\"They [theUnited States] desire to maintain the jurisdiction\nof the Tribunal of Arbitration over all the unsettled claims, in\norder that, being judicially decided, and th\u00a3 questions of law\ninvolved therein being adjudicated, all questions connected\nwith or arising out of the Alabama Claims, or ' growing out of\nthe acts' of tjje cruisers, may be forever removed from the possibility of disturbing the perfect harmony of relations between\nthe two countries. . . .\n\" What the rights, duties, and true interests of both the contending nations, and of all nations, demand shall be the extent,\nand the measure of liability and damages under the Treaty, is\na matter for the supreme determination of the Tribunal established thereby.\n\" Should that august Tribunal decide that a State is not liable for the indirect or consequential results of an accidental or\nunintentional violation of its neutral obligations, the United\nStates will unhesitatingly accept the decision.\n\" Should it, on the other hand, decide that Great Britain is\nliable to this Government for such consequential results, they\nhave that full faith in British observance of its engagements to\nexpect a compliance with the judgment of the Tribunal, which\na solemn Treaty between the two Powers has created in order\nto remove and adjust all complaints and claims on the part of\nthe United States.\"\nThe American Government could not avoid feeling\nthat the public discussion, which the British Ministers had seen fit to excite, or, at any rate, to aggravate, 54\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nand \"the discourteous tone and minatory intimations\nof the Ministry,\" imposed on the United States a different line of action from that, which might have been\nadopted by them in response to a calm presentation\nby the British Government of its construction of the\nTreaty.\nIn this relation there is another class of facts which,\nas it seems to me, deserves mention.\nOf the five American Commissioners engaged in\nthe negotiation of the Treaty of Washington, two,\nthe Secretary \u00a9f State [Mr. Fish] and our Minister\nat London [General Schenck], were officially occupied in discussing the question on the American Case\nraised by the British Government. The published\ndispatches show wMi what signal ability they discharged this delicate duty. Meanwhile, the three\nother Commissioners, Mr. Justice Nelson, Mr. Hoar,\nand Mr. Williams, although impliedly accused on the\nother side of taking some advantage of the unsophisticated innocence and simplicity of the British Commissioners, yet maintained perfect self-control in the\nmatter, speaking only when officially called upon to\nspeak, and otherwise leaving the subject where it belonged,\u2014in the hands of their Government.\nThe conduct, on the other hand, of some of the\nBritish Commissioners was less reserved than that of\nthe American Commissioners. Professor Bernard got\ncompletely, off the' track of reason and sense in a lecture Which he delivered at Oxford. Sir Stafford\nNorthcote let off a very inconsiderate speech at Exeter.    And Sir Edward Thornton made a not very\nIB ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n55\nconsiderate one at New York. But Earl de Grey\nand Ripon, who had now become Marquess of Ripon,\ndeported himself with admirable dignity. It was, indeed, wittily said, or reported to have been said, by\nMr. Lowe, that Lord Ripon was going about very sick\nat the stomach of a marquisate, which he would be\nglad to throw up; but the reproach was wholly undeserved. Lord Ripon manfully maintained silence\nwhile to speak would have been unwise; when at\nlength it became expedient to speak, he did so with\ndiscretion and with judiciousness, beyond what appeared in the speeches of some other members of the\nGovernment.\nACTION OF THE AMERICAN AGENT AND COUNSEL.\nWhilst all these discussions were going on in Great\nBritain and the United States, we, the Agent and\nCounsel of the United States, were busily occupied,\npartly at Washington' but chiefly at Paris, in the\nstudy of the British Case and the preparation of the\nAmerican Counter-Case. We had fixed on Paris for\nour head-quarters, as a neutral city, as a great centre\nof international jurisprudence and diplomacy, and as\na place in easy communication with London and with\nWashington.\nFrom this ground of vantage we could observe\nand estimate correctly the current of discussion in\nAmerica, in Great Britain, and on the Continent of\nEurope.\nSpeaking for myself, at least, let me say, it appeared to me that much of what was being said in En-\n0 >6\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ngland, whether in Parliament or in the Press, was unseasonable or indiscreet; much of it factious toward\nthe British Government itself; much of it disrespectful to the American Government; but none of it of\nany ultimate importance or consequence in regard to\neither Government, for the following reasons:\n\u20221. Both Governments sincerely desired peace. Great >\nBritain could never have retreated from the Arbitration in violation of the Treaty, whatever the Press\nmight say, and whoever should be in power as Min- \u2022\nister.\n2. Freedom of debate is essential to freedom of institutions. To be sure, the Press in Great Britain,\nand somewhat, but less so, in the United States, is\nprone to take upon itself rather lofty airs, and to\nspeak of public affairs quite absolutely, as if it were\nthe Government. But nobody is deceived by this,\nnot even the Press itself. We, the English-speaking\nnations, thank heaven, possess the capability of living\nin the atmosphere of oral and written debate. It was\nsafe to predict that howmuchsoever Mr. Gladstone\nand Lord Granville might feel annoyed by the din\nof words around them, it would not induce them to\nbreak faith with the United States.\n3. It was not the voice of the English Press which\ncould seriously affect us. We looked rather to the\nstate of opinion in. the French, German, and Italian\nspeaking countries of Europe, which, on the whole,\nthough differing as to the legal right of the United\nStates to recover on the national claims, yet decisively agreed with us in affirming that those claims were\nMl ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n57\ncomprehended within the scope of the Treaty as maintained by the United States.\nWhat Europe dreaded, what all European opinion\nsought to prevent, was a rupture between Great Britain and the United States, to disturb the money-\nmarket of Europe, and impede the payment by France\nof the indemnity due to Germany. And all men saw\nthat the United States must and would resent the\nrefusal by Great Britain to observe the stipulations\nof the Treaty of Washington.\nPRESENTATION OF COUNTER-CASES.\nSuch were the circumstances, in the presence of\nwhich arrived the time, namely, the 15th of April, at\nwhich the two Governments were to file at Geneva\ntheir respective Counter-Cases.\nThe British Government was so solicitous to fulfill\non its part all the stipulations of the Treaty, that it\ncaused special inquiry to be made whether the American Government had any objection to Great Britain filing her Counter-Case without prejudice to her\nposition regarding consequential damages; to which\nMr. Fish replied that the British Government was\nbound to file its Counter-Case, but its doing so\nwould not prejudice any position it had taken, nor\naffect any position of the United States.\nAccordingly, on the 15th of April, the Counter-\nCases of Great Britain and the United States were\nduly filed, with express reservation of all the rights\nof both Governments.\nThe British Counter-Case, consisting of four vol- 58\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\numes folio, contains little new matter, being in part,\nat least, defensive argument in response to the American \" Case.\" \u2022\nThe American Counter-Case, consisting of two\nvolumes folio, replies argumentatively to the British\n\"Case,\" and brings forward a large body of documentary proofs, responsive to matters contained in\nthat \" Case,\" which, although utterly foreign to the\nquestion at issue, required to be met, because considered material by Great Britain, namely, allegations\nof default on the part of the United States in the\nexecution of their own neutrality laws, to the prejudice of other Governments.\nThe introduction of all this matter into the British\nCase, the iteration of it in the British Counter-Case\nand the British Argument, and the extreme prominence given to it, as we shall hereafter see, by the\nBritish Arbitrator, serve to illustrate the singular\nunreasonableness and injustice of the angry complaints emitted in England against the American\nCase.\nThe American Case contains no suggestion which\nis not strictly pertinent to the issues raised by the\nTreaty. It discusses the conduct of the British Government relatively to the United States during our\nCivil War, with strict application to the \"Alabama\nClaims.\" It charges that, in those transactions, the\nBritish Government was guilty of culpable omission\nto observe the requirements of the law of nations as\nrespects the United States, and with responsible negligence in the non-execution of the neutrality laws of ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n59\nGreat Britain. That was the very question presented by the Treaty.\nGreat Britain professed to be^o much offended by\nthe character of certain of the proofs adduced in the\nAmerican Case,\u2014rigorously pertinent to the question\nas all those proofs were,\u2014that she would not suffer\nany appropriate answer to those proofs to be brought\nforward in her Counter-Case or in her Argument: it\nwas not compatible with self-respect,\u2014it would be\ngiving dignity to undignified arguments,\u2014we were\ntold by the British Press. Meanwhile, the very matter which the British Government could not condescend to notice was both material and important to\nsuch a degree as very much to inflame the temper and\nexercise the ingenuity of Sir Alexander Cockburn,\nthe \" representative\", of Great Britain* at Geneva.\nNow, the American Case, if conceived in any other\nspirit than that of just and fair exposition of the precise issue,\u2014question, that is, whether the British Government had or had not incurred responsibility for\nits want of due diligence in the matter of Confederate\ncruisers fitted out in the ports of Great Britain,\u2014I\nsay, if the American Government, in the preparation\nof its Case, had not been animated \"by the spirit of\nperfect fairness and justness, it might have gone into\nthe inquiry of the political conduct of Great Britain\nin other times, and with reference to other nations, in\nthe view of imputing to her habitual disregard of the\nlaw of nations in illustration of her present conduct\ntoward the United States. We might have charged\nthat, while her statesmen contend that they could do CO\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nnothing outside of an Act of Parliament, they had no\nsuch Act until 1819, and were therefore, prior to that\ntime, confessedly impotent, and we might have added\nwillfully so, to observe the duties of neutrality; we\nmight have scrutinized her national history to select\nconspicuous examples of her acts of violence, in disregard of the law of nations, against numerous States,\nincluding ourselves; we might have appealed to every volume of international law in existence, from the\ntime of Grotius to this day, and cited page after page\nto the conclusion of the unjust .international policy\nof Great Britain; and we might have argued from all\nthis to infer intentional omission of the British Government to prevent the escape of the Alabama and\nthe Florida.\nBut such arguments, you will sajr, would have been\nforced, remote, of doubtful relevance, and of a nature\noffensive to England. Be it so: they would, if you\nplease, have been irrelevant, impertinent, offensive.\nAnd no such arguments are found in the American\nCase.\nBut such are the arguments which pervade the *\nBritish Case, Counter-Case, and Argument, and the\nopinions of the British member of the Tribunal. Instead of defending its own' conduct in the matter\nat issue, the British Government travels out of the\nrecord to find fault with the conduct of the United\nStates at other times, and with respect to other nations. It presumes to take upon itself the function\nof personating Spain, Portugal, Nicaragua, and to drag\nbefore the Tribunal at Geneva controversies between\nMil ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n61\nus and other States, with which that Tribunal had\nno possible concern,\u2014which it could not pretend to\njudge,\u2014and of such obvious irrelevancy and impertinence that not one of the Arbitrators condescended\nto notice them except Sir Alexander Cockburn.\nThe presentation in the British Case of considerations of this order, worthless and absurd as argument, and wantonly offensive to the United States,\nwas, in my judgment, an outrageous act, compared\nwith which, in possible susceptibility of blame, there\nis nothing to be found in any of the affirmative documents presented by the American Government.\nIt was the cause of a singularly perverse incident,\nnamely, complaint of the British Press against the\nAmerican Argument for imputed unkindness in alluding to subjects, which had been forced upon our\nattention by the British Case.\nI mention these circumstances for the purpose of\nshowing how relatively unjust it was to impute of-\nfensiveness of spirit and language to the American\nCase in view of the much more objectionable things\nin the British Case; and for the further purpose of\npertinently stating that it was undignified for Great\nBritain to complain of the manner in which the Agent\nor Counsel of the United States might see fit to ar-\ngue our cause, as it would be for the American Government to undertake to prescribe limits of discretion in this respect to the Agent or Counsel of Great\nBritain.\nThus, the 15th of April, looked forward to with so\nmuch  apparent'dread by the  British Government,- 62\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\npassed away, leaving the great question, unsettled, in\nwhat manner ultimately to deal with the claim for\nnational losses preferred by the United States.\nNEGOTIATIONS FOR A  SUPPLEMENTAL TREATY.\nA new series of events then happened, which occupied the period intervening between the 15th of April\nand the loth of June.\nIt occurred to the two Governments that the difficulty might be disposed of by the exchange of diplomatic notes, which, in laying down a definite rule of\nreciprocal international right on the subject of such\nlosses, should reserve or leave unimpaired the present\npretensions of both Governments. The British Government would not admit that it was the intention\nof the Treaty to cover national losses; the United\nStates insisted that it was, and refused to do any act\nincompatible with this construction of the Treaty;\nand, therefore, they would not withdraw any part of\nthe American Case, nor disavow the opinion that it\nwas within the province of the Arbitrators to consider all the claims, and to determine the liability of\nGreat Britain for all the claims, which- had been put\nforward by the United States. But the American\nGovernment had not asked for pecuniary damages in\nits \" Case\" on account of that part of the claims called\nthe indirect losses; it only desired a judgment thereon, which would remove them for all future time as a\ncause of difference between the two Governments.\nTo hold that this class of claims was not disposed of\nby the Treaty,\u2014that is, was not a subject for the con- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n63\nsideration of the Tribunal of Arbitration,\u2014was to infer\nthat they remained open and unadjusted, and susceptible of being hereafter brought forward anew by the\nUnited States as an object of reclamation against\nGreat Britain. One great inducement to the Treaty\nwould thus be defeated, namely, the establishment of\nperfect concord and peace. In view of which it was\nthought expedient to endeavor to adjust the present\ndispute by informal stipulations on the part of the\ntwo Governments.\nThis well-intentioned effort failed, because of the\npersistent contention of the British Government that\nthe Treaty excluded from the Arbitration the claims\nfor national losses advanced by the United States.\nFurther reflection on the subject satisfied the American Government that nothing short of a new treaty\ncould dispose of the question on the premises of the\npending negotiation, it being clear that the President\nof the United States could not of himself withdrato\nclaims which were in his opinion justified by the\nTreaty of Washington.\nThereupon the President requested of the Senate\nan expression of their disposition in regard to advising and consenting to the formal adoption of an article of treaty proposed by the British Government, to\nthe effect of stipulating that he would make no claim\non the part of the United States in respect of the so-\ncalled indirect losses before the Tribunal of Arbitration, in consideration of an agreement between the\ntwo Governments, the essence of which was set forth\nin a preamble to the effect that\njyfc 64\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\n\" Such indirect claims as those for national losses stated in\nthe Case presented on the part of the Government of the United\nStates . . . should not be admitted in principle as growing out\nof the acts committed by particular vessels, alleged to have\nbeen enabled to commit depredations on the shipping of a belligerent by reason of such want of due diligence in the performance of neutral obligations as that which is imputed by the\nUnited States to Great Britain:\"\nwhich proposed agreement the preamble proceeds to\nstate, in the form of two separate declarations,\u2014one\nby Great Britain and one by the United States,\u2014\neach of them intelligible only by reference to previous parts of the preamble: the whole to the conclusion that the President shall make no claim, on\nthe.part of the United States, in respect of the indirect claims as aforesaid, before the Tribunal of Arbitration at Geneva.\nThe Senate, thinking that the recitals in the preamble were not sufficiently explicit to furnish to the\nUnited States satisfactory basis of transaction, proposed the following substitute:\n| Whereas both Governments adopt for the future the principle that claims for remote or indirect losses should not be\nadmitted as the result of failure to observe neutral obligations,\nso far as to declare that it will hereafter guide the conduct of\nboth Governments in their relations with each other. Now,\ntherefore,\" etc.\nBut the Senate's redaction of the article rendered\nits meaning too clear to be agreeable to the British.\nCJ o\nGovernment, which, as was shrewdly said of it in\nParis at the time, doubted whether release from claim\nof reparation for the present wrong done by Great ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n65\nBritain to the United States might not be purchased\ntoo dearly by conceding to the United States, in consideration thereof, indefinite and unlimited exemption\nfrom responsibility for wrongs of the same nature to\nbe inflicted in all future time by the United States\non Great Britain.\nFurther interchange of dispatches on this subject\nfollowed, the British Government insisting on modification of the terms of arrangement proposed by the\nSenate.\nBut Congress had now adjourned. The 15th of\nJune was impending, on which day the United States\nmust of necessity present their final argument or lose\ntheir hold on the Treaty. If, at the commencement\nof the difficulty, the British Government had proposed\nto the American Government to agree to postpone\nthe proceedings of the Tribunal and take time for\nnegotiation in the usual way, a new treaty might\nhave been concluded as contemplated by the two\nGovernments. Such a treaty, requiring careful consideration of phraseology, with discussion and explanations regarding the same, could not be concluded\nin haste by means of telegraphic communication between London and Washington.\nThe spectacle exhibited by the two Governments\nat this time was one of profound\u00abinterest to the whole\nworld. They were inspired by friendly sentiments on\neach side. They differed in regard to the construction\nof a treaty which neither desired to break. Diplomatic correspondence had failed to bring them into\nconcord of opinion.   They endeavored to reconcile\nE Q6\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthis difference by supplemental treaty. Only a few\nweeks remained in which to negotiate; and the\nparties were separated by thousands of miles of\nocean. It was necessary, therefore, to negotiate, if at\nall, by telegraph,\u2014an operation quite as novel as had\nbeen that of conducting the business of government\nin France by means of pigeons or balloons during the\nsiege of Paris. But, before it was possible for the\nparties to conclude a treaty by telegraph, the fatal\nday arrived, greatly to the embarrassment of the\nBritish Government.\nPRESENTATION OF ARGUMENTS FOR THE UNITED STATES.\nFor the course of the United States in this exigen-\n*\ncy was plain before them: it was to present their\nfinal Argument to the Tribunal of Arbitration, in conformity with their own conception of their rights, just\nas if there, were no controversy on the point between\nthem and Great Britain.\nThe President of the United States was immovably fixed in the purpose not to withdraw the controverted claims, nor to abstain from making claim before the Tribunal in respect to the so-called indirect\nlosses, except in consideration of a new treaty regarding the same, satisfactory to himself and to the Senate\nof the United States.\nIn a dispatch of the Secretary of State to the Minister at London, of the 28th of May, 1872, the inducement and object of the United States, in persisting to\nretain these claims before the Tribunal, are summarily stated as follows: ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n67\n1. \" The right under the Treaty to present them.\n2. | To have them disposed of and removed from further controversy.\n3. | To obtain a decision either for or against the liability of\na neutral for claims of flhat description.\n4. \" If the liability of a neutral for such claims is admitted\nin the future, then to insist on payment by Great Britain for\nthose of the past.\n5. \" Having a case against Great Britain to have the same\nprinciple applied to it that may in the future be invoked against\nthe United States.\"\nOf these considerations, the last four, it is obvious,\nare the complete justification of the insertion of our.\nnational claims in the Treaty and of their presenta-.\ntion in the \" Case.\"\nHence the duty of the Agent and Counsel of the\nUnited States, having charge of the judicial investigation pending before the Tribunal of Arbitration,\nremained the same in the interval between December\n15th, 1871, and June 15th, 1872, whatever diplomatic\ndiscussions or negotiations might be going on between:\nthe two Governments. Our instructions were definite and peremptory, as the British Government well\nunderstood, to prepare the Counter-Case for the United States, and the final Argument, on the premises\nof the Treaty as construed by the United States and\nas explained in the American Case. Our Counter-\nCase was prepared accordingly, as already stated, and\nfiled in English and in French before the Tribunal.\nAnd in like manner we prepared our final Argument.\n' This Argument, consisting of an octavo volume of\n495 pages, after discussing fully the various questions^\nof fact and of law involved in the submission to .arbi- 6.8\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ntration, proceeds to examine the particular claims, national as well as individual,\u2014to maintain the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over both classes of claims,\u2014and\nto argue the nature and degree df the responsibility\nof Great Britain to the United States in the premises.\nIn fine, the Argument is co-extensive with the \" Case.\"\nWe repaired to Geneva in due time, and at the\nmee\"ting of the Tribunal on the 15th we presented\nour Argument as required by the Treaty, and, for the\nbetter information of the Tribunal, in French as well\nas in English. That is to say, the Government of\nthe United States, through the means of its official\nAgent, complied with that last command of the Treaty of Washington, in virtue of which the Tribunal of\nArbitration became formally seized and possessed of\nall our claims, national as well as private, precisely as\nif no controversy on the subject existed between the\ntwo Governments. The United States were in condition to invoke the judgment of the Tribunal, whether\nGreat Britain appeared or not; for Counsel had ample authority of legal doctrine at hand to show that\nthe Tribunal would have power to act even in the\nabsence of Great Britain.\nIn the anticipation of this contingency, the British\nGovernment requested that of the United States to\nconcur in making a joint application to the Tribunal\nfor an adjournment of eight months, in order to afford\nto the two Governments sufficient time for further\nnegotiation. Mr. Fish replied that the Government\nof the United States had no reason to desire such adjournment, although the Government intended, and ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n69\ninstructed its Agent, to assent to a motion for adjournment on the part of Great Britain, provided the\nBritish Argument were filed in good faith, without\noffensive notice, or other objectionable accompaniment.\nThus it became necessary, for the British Government to decide for itself how to act in the premises.\nThe course adopted by it was to withhold its Argument, and to file a statement, setting forth the recent\nnegotiations for the solution of the difficulty between\nthe two Governments, and the hope that, if time were\nafforded, such a solution might be found practicable;\nand thereupon to move an adjournment of eight\nmonths, with reserve of all rights in the event of\" an\nagreement not being finally arrived at, as expressed in\nthe note which accompanied the British Counter-Case.\nDECISION OF THE ARBITRATORS RESPECTING NATIONAL\nLOSSES.\nThese acts having been performed, the Arbitrators\nadjourned, first to the 17th, and then to the 19th of\nJune, in order to afford time for reflection to themselves and to the two Governments.\nIt will be taken for granted that in the interval between the 15th and the 19th of June communications\nby telegraph passed between the respective Agents\nand their Governments, and *consultations took place\nbetween the Counsel of both sides and the respective\nAgents, either orally or in writing, and, with more or\nless formality, among the Arbitrators, the result of\nwhich was announced by Count Sclopis as follows:. 70\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\n\"The Arbitrators do not propose to express or imply any\nopinion upon the point thus in difference between the two\nGovernments as to the interpretation or effect of the Treaty,\nbut it seems to them obvious that the substantial object of\nthe adjournment must be to give the two Governments an opportunity of determining whether the claims in question shall\nor shall not be submitted to the decision of the Arbitrators,\nand that any difference between the two Governments on this\npoint may make the adjournment unproductive of any useful\neffect, and, after a delay of many months, during which both\nnations may be kept in a state of painful suspense, may end in\na result which it is to be presumed both Governments would\nequally deplore, that of making this arbitration wholly abortive. This being so, the Arbitrators think it right to state\nthat, after the most careful perusal of all that has been urged\non the part of the Government of the United States in respect\nof these claims, they have arrived, individually and collectively, at the conclusion that these claims do not constitute, upon\nthe principles of international law applicable to such cases,\ngood foundation for an award of compensation or computation\nof damages between nations; and should, upon such principles, be wholly excluded from the consideration of the Tribunal in making its award, even if there were no disagreement\nbetween the two Governments as to the competency of the\nTribunal to decide thereon. With a view to the settlement\nof the other claims, to the consideration of which by the Tribunal no exception has been taken on the part 'of Her Britannic Majesty's Government, the Arbitrators have thought it desirable to lay before the parties this expression of the views\nthey have formed upon the question of public law involved, in\norder that, after this declaration by the Tribunal, it may be\nconsidered by the Government of the United States whether\nany course can be adopted respecting the first - mentioned\nclaims which would relieve The Tribunal from the necessity of\ndeciding upon the present application of Her Britannic Majesty's Government.\" ,\nCount Sclopis added that it was the intention of\nthe Tribunal that this statement should be consid- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n71\nered for the present to be confidential,\u2014that is, subject to the discretion of either of the two Governments.\nBut what is the \" question of public law involved ?\"\nIs it the question of claim for indirect or consequential damages, as argued by the British Government ?\nBy no means.\nObserve, no suggestion of any distinction between\ndirect and indirect claims is to be found in the declaration of the Arbitrators. And their declaration can\nnot be explained by reference to any such order of\nideas.\nThe significant words are: \"These claims do not\nconstitute, upon the principles of international law\napplicable to such cases, good foundation for an award\nof compensation or computation of damages between\nnations.\"\nWhy do they not? Because they are indirect?\nBecause they are consequential? No such objection\nis intimated.\nBut although, in making this declaration, a mere\nconclusion of mind, the Arbitrators abstained at the\ntime from assigning any reasons for such conclusion,\nyet they supplied this omission subsequently, as we\nshall plainly see when we come to review the ensemble of all the acts of the Tribunal. We shall then be\nable to appreciate the importance and value of this\ndeclaration to the United States.\nThe Counsel of the United States advised the acceptance of this declaration by the 'Government, as\nfollows: 72\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\n\" We are of opinion that the announcement this day made\nby the Tribunal must be received by the United States as determinative of its judgment on the question of public law involved, as to which the United States have insisted on taking\nthe opinion of the Tribunal. We advise, therefore,.that it\nshould be submitted to, as precluding the propriety of further\ninsisting upon the claims covered by this declaration of the\nTribunal, and that the United States, with a view of maintaining the due course of the arbitration on the other claims without adjournment, should announce to the Tribunal that the\nsaid claims covered by its opinion will not be further insisted\nupon before the Tribunal by the United States, and may be\nexcluded from all consideration by the Tribunal in making its\naward.\"\nIn response, the Secretary of State communicated\nthe determination of the President, as follows:\n\" I have laid your telegrams before the President, who directs me to say that he accepts the declaration of the Tribunal\nas its judgment upon a question of public law, which he had\nfelt that the interests of both Governments required should\nbe decided, and for the detei-mination of which he had felt it\nimportant to present the claims referred to for the purpose of\ntaking the opinion of the Tribunal.\n\" This is the attainment of an end which this Government\nhad in view in the putting forth of those claims. We had no\ndesire for a pecuniary award, but desired an expression by the\nTribunal as to the liability of a neutral for claims of that character. The President, therefore, further accepts the opinion\nand advice of the Counsel as set forth above, and authorizes\nthe announcement to the Tribunal that he accepts their decla:\nration as determinative of their judgment upon the important\nquestion of publicMaw as to which he had felt it his duty to\nseek the expression of their opinion; and that, in accordance\nwith such judgment and opinion, from henceforth he regards\nthe claims set forth in the Case presented on the part of the\nUnited States for loss in the transfer of the American commercial marine to the British .flag, the enhanced payment of insurance, and the prolongation of the war, and the addition of a ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n73\nlarge sum to the cost of the war and the suppression of the\nRebellion, as adjudicated and disposed of; and that, consequently, they will not be further insisted upon before the Tribunal\nby the United States, but are henceforth excluded from its consideration by the Tribunal in making its award.\"\nThis conclusion was announced to the Tribunal by\nthe Agent of the United States on the 25th of June\nin the following words:\n\"The declaration made by the Tribunal, individually and\ncollectively, 'respecting the claims presented by the United\nStates for the award of the Tribunal for, first, the losses in the\ntransfer of the American commercial marine to the British flag;\nsecond, the enhanced payment of insurance; and, third, the prolongation of the war, and the addition of a large sum. to the\ncost of the war and the suppression of the Rebellion, is accepted\nby the President of the.United States as determinative of their\njudgment upon the important question of public law involved.\"\nOn the 27th, the British Agent announced the acquiescence of his Government in this arrangement,\nwithdrew his motion of adjournment, and filed the\nBritish Argument.\nAnd in this manner the controversy, which for so\nmany months had engrossed the attention of the two\nGovernments, was finally disposed of as the Government, of the United States had constantly contended\nit should be [unless otherwise settled by treaty],\u2014\nthat is, by the declaration of the judgment or opinion\nof the Arbitrators, in. such form as to constitute, in\neffect, a rule of law, morally binding on Great Britain\nand the.United States,\nThe President of the Tribunal, Count Sclopis, then\nproceeded to pronounce an appropriate and well-\nwritten discourse, expressing satisfaction at the re- 74\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON,\nmOval of all obstacles to the free action of the Tribunal, and commenting on the political relations of the\nTreaty of Washington, preparatory to the consideration of the other questions submitted to the Arbitrators.\nSEAT OF THE ARBITRATION.\nAnd here, before proceeding to explain and to discuss the subsequent acts of the Tribunal, it seems\nconvenient to pause, in order to speak of the scene\nof action and of the Tribunal, to which the eyes of\nall nations were attracted, and especially those of the\npeople of England and of America.\nIt was most fit and proper to select Switzerland\nas the country, and Geneva as the city, in which to\nhold the sessions .of the Tribunal.\nIn fact, Switzerland, at the same time that it is the\nland of hospitality, inviting the frequentation of all\nthe world by its picturesque scenery, the beauty and\nsublimity of its lakes and mountains, is also the land\nof neutrality par excellence. No other country possesses in the same degree these qualities conjoined.\nIn no other country was it possible to avoid all invidious local suspicion, and to be exempt, from any\npossible political influence foreign to the objects of\nthe Arbitration.\nThe selection was peculiarly agreeable to the\nUnited States, by reason of the striking similarity\nbetween our institutions and those of Switzerland.\nBoth Governments cultivate a policy of international\nneutrality: the one, by reason of its isolation and re- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n75\nmoteness from the Old World, and the other because\nof its geographical position in the midst of the great\nmilitary Powers of Europe. Both Governments are\nfederal; and Switzerland, not content with those\nmodifications of her system of government adopted\nin the year 1848, which did so much to assimilate\nher political organization to that of the United\nStates, now manifests the purpose to amend that\nConstitution so as to make it still more like to ours.\nIn both countries the force of public life pervades\nsociety like the blood in the human system, so that\nevery citizen is ^n active member of the Republic.\nHence it is impossible to an intelligent American to\navoid entertaining warm sympathy for the Swiss\nConfederation.\nGeneva is a cosmopolitan city, \u2014 situated in the\nvery heart of Europe,\u2014distinguished for the intelligence of its inhabitants and their love of liberty. It\nis city, in respect of the commodities of life: it is\ncountry, in so far as regards the locality and the surrounding natural objects, Lake Leman, the Jura, and\nthe Alps.\nThe Federal Government, as well as that of the\n\u2022Canton of Geneva, appreciated the honor of being the\nseat of this great international Tribunal, and did not\nfail to welcome most cordially the two Governments,\ntheir Agents and their Counsel, by conspicuous manifestations of political as well as of personal consideration. The Cantonal Government at Geneva hastened\nto provide suitable accommodations for the Tribunal in\nthe Hotel de Ville of that city; it afforded to the mem-\n\\-~ 76\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nbers of the Tribunal and to the representatives of the\ntwo Governments access to numerous official exhibitions and entertainments; and, at a suitable time, it\nmade for us a special festival at Geneva, as the Federal Government did at Interlaken and at Berne.\nSwitzerland, and Geneva especially, looking at the\nseveral acts of arbitration provided by th\u00a3 Treaty of\nWashington as constituting great steps in the progress of public peace, welcomed us the more heartily\nbecause of the recent organization there of a society,\nwhose objects are defined by its title of \" Comite International de Secours aux MilitaireS Blesses.\" This\nsociety had acquired universal respect by its acts of\ndisinterested philanthropy in the late war between\nGermany and France. Its symbol of ..the red cross\nhad been the harbinger of relief to many a suffering\nvictim of battle. It was organized under the Pres-\nidency of that General Dufour who, in 1847, had led\nto victory the forces of Switzerland against the Secession [Sonderbund] Cantons. And men could not fail\nto note the coincidence, when they saw this great\nTribunal of Arbitration organized under the auspices\nof the victorious commander of our own Union forces\n[General Grant], as the International Commission for\nthe Succor of the Wounded had been under the\nauspices of the veteran General Dufour. It was impressive to see the greatest Generals of the two countries laboring to diminish the chances and lighten the\nevils of war.\nThe Tribunal of Arbitration occupied the same hall\nin the Hotel deVille which had just before been oo ALABAMA CLAIMS,\n77\ncupied by the Society for the Succor of the Wounded:\na room of moderate dimensions, but adequate to the\npurpose, fitted up with elegance and good taste, not,\nhowever, specially for the Commission or Tribunal,\nbut for ordinary uses of the City or Canton, indicated\nby its title \" Salle des Conferences.\"\nThe Hotel de Ville is a structure in the Florentine\nstyle of architecture\", situated on the summit of the\nold Geneva, and which is occupied both by municipal officers of the City and by the executive and legislative authorities of the Canton.\nCOUNT FREDERIC SCLOPIS.\nHere, then, in the \"Salle des Conferences\" of the\nHotel de Ville, at Geneva, the Tribunal assembled to\nlisten to the opening discourse of the President, Count\nSclopis, and to take up the business remaining for the\nconsideration of the Arbitrators.\nCount Sclopis, in this discourse, expressed belief\nthat the meeting of the Tribunal indicated of itself\nthe impression of new direction on the public policy\nof nations the most advanced in civilization, and the\ncommencement of an epoch in which the'spirit of\nmoderation and the sentiment of equity were beginning.to prevail over the tendency of the old routines\nof arbitrary violence or culpable indifference. He\nsignified regret that the pacific views of the Congress\nof Palis had not been seconded by events in Europe.\nHe congratulated the world that the statesmen who\ndirected the destinies of Great Britain and the United\nStates, with rare firmness of conviction and devotion 78\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nto the interests of humanity, resisting all temptations\nof vulgar ambition, had magnanimously and courageously traversed in peace the difficulties which had\ndivided them both before and since the conclusion of\nthe Treaty. He quoted approvingly the opinion expressed by Mr. Gladstone, on the one hand, and by\nPresident Washington, on the other, in commendation\nof the policy of peace, of justice, and of honor in the\nconduct of nations. And he proclaimed in behalf of\nhis colleagues, as well as of himself, the purpose of\nthe Tribunal, acting sometimes with the large perception of statesmen, sometimes with the scrutinizing eye\nof judges, and always with a profound sentiment of\nequity and with absolute impartiality, thus to discharge its high duty of pacification as well as of justice to the two Governments.\nThe discourse was worthy of the occasion and of\nthe man.   \u2022\nCount Frederic Sclopis of Salerano, Minister of\nState and Senator of the new Kingdom of Italy, has\nattained the ripe age of seventy;four years in the assiduous cultivation of letters, and in the discharge of\nthe highest political and judicial functions. The\ncountryman and the friend of Count Cavour, it was\nhis fortune to co-operate in the task of the unification\nof Italy under the leadership of the House of Savoy.\nThis great military House, with its enterprising,\nambitious, and politic instincts, second in fortune only\nto the Habsburgs and the Zollerns, rose in the eleventh century, on the ruins of the Burgundians, to the\npossession of the passes of the Valaisian, Cottian, and ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n79\nGraian Alps, and of the Gallic territory on both\nshores of Lake Leman, and at length to the possession\nof extensive Italian territories, denominated Piedmont\nby relation to the Alps and the Apennines, the\nnucleus of the present Kingdom of Italy.\nIt needs to conceive and picture to the mind's eye\nthe Alpine cradle of this adventurous and martial, but\ncultivated race of Italianized Savoisian princes, nobles,\nand people,\u2014the fertile, but ravaged valleys of the\nRhone, the Arve, the Albarine, the Arc, and the two\nDoras; the castellated heights of L'Ecluse, Mont-\nmelian, and La Brunnetta; the vine-clad hill-sides and\nthe lofty cols dominated by the giant peaks of Mont\nBlanc and Monte Rosa; the sepulchral monuments of\nHaute-Combe and of*Brou,and the rich plains along\nthe Italian foot of the AlpSj\u2014in order to comprehend\nthe growth to greatness of sovereigns such as Vittorio\nEmanuele, supported by such generals as Menabrea\nand Cialdini, and statesmen and magistrates such as\nAzeglio, Balbo, Sclopis, and especially Cavour.\nlike his compatriot, the Marquis d'Azeglio, Count\nSclopis is eminent as an author. Of his published\nwritings, some are in French, such as \" Marie Louise\nGabrielle de Savoie \" and \" Cardinal Morone.\" But\nhis most important works are in Italian; and above\nall, the learned \" Storia della Legislazione Italiana,\"\nthe last edition of which, in five volumes, is a most interesting and instructive exhibition of the successive\nstages of the mediaeval and modern legislation of all\nthe different States of Italy.\nSuch was the eminent personage who presided over 80\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nand conducted the deliberations'of the Tribunal, and\nwho represented and spoke for it on ceremonial occasions : a man of large stature and dignified presence;\nof the high breeding of rank, but without pretensive-\nness; cordial and kindly in social intercourse; the\nimpersonation, as it were, of the intellect and the culture of Continental Europe.\nMR. STJEMPFLI.\nSitting by the right hand of Count Sclopis, as next\nto him in precedence, not by reason of age,\u2014for he\nwas the youngest member of the Tribunal,\u2014but as\nrepresenting the local Government, Switzerland, was\nMr. James [or, in German, Jacob] Stsempfli: a genuine representative of democratic*nstitutions,\u2014sprung\nfrom the people,\u2014the son of his own works,\u2014clearheaded, strong-minded, firm-hearted,\u2014somewhat positive,\u2014not prone to talk except when talk was of the\nessence of things, and then briefly and to the point,\u2014\nin a word, a man of the very stuff out of which to\nmake Presidents of Federal Republics.\nMr. Staampfli is a German Swiss of the Canton of\nBerne, who has risen from the humblest to the highest\ncondition in his country by mere force of intellect and\nindomitable will. Born in 1820, admitted to the Bar\nin 1843, he came forward at once as an advocate, and\nas a journalist of radical opinions, and speedily attained distinction. In 1846 we find him a conspicuous member of the Council of State, directing the\nfinances, and laboring to organize a central militarv\nforce.   In 1847 he represented the Canton of Berne ALABAMA CLAIMS..\n81\nin the Diet, and was active in asserting the rights of\n1 CD CD\nthe Federation against the seceding States of the\nSonderbund. He served in that war as Treasurer\nand Paymaster-Genera^ of the Army. Displaced for\na while, he resumed the practice of his profession as\nadvocate, but soon returned to power, in 1851, as President of the National Council, where he continued to\nbe distinguished as a close reasoner and incisive speaker, full of intelligence and of resources, supported by\ngreat energy of character. In 1856, he was elected\nPresident of the Confederation, and again in 1859,\nand the third time in 1862: these repeated but interrupted f e-elections illustrating the Swiss Constitution, according to which the \"President is elected for\none year only, and Can not be re-elected for the next\nsucceeding year, but is otherwise re-eligible without\nlimitation. Events of great importance to Switzerland occurred in the years of the administration of\n\" Mr. Staernpfli; among others, the separation of Neu-\nchatel from Prussia, the war in Italy, and the annexion\nof Savoy to France. His theory of executive action\nwas characteristic of the man, namely,\" When peril\nis certain, it is better to advance to meet it, rather\nthan timidly to await its approach.\" In fine, preparation and decision are the distinctive traits of all the\nofficial acts of Mr. Staernpfli.\nThere is one peculiarity in the political character\nof Mr. Staernpfli, which belongs to him, indeed, as a\nSwiss, namely, definiteness and affirmativeness in\nthe matter of international neutrality and morality.\nSwitzerland no longer permits capitulations of for-\nF 82\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\neign enlistment: they are expressly forbidden by the\nFederal Constitution. Her laws punish as a crime\nall violation by individuals of the international rights\nof foreign Powers. Her neutrality is active, not pas-\nsive,\u2014preventive, as well as punitive. She has no\nmaritime relations, it is true; but, in dealing with unlawful equipments or expeditions by land, she observes rules of neutrality which are applicable, in theory and practice, equally to equipments or expeditions for naval warfare. Our own temporary act of\n1838, which comprehends vehicles [on land] and vessels [on water] in the same clause of criminality, affords complete answer to those Englishmen who have\nsuperficially assumed that because Switzerland is not\na maritime PoWer, she [or a statesman of hers] could\nnot competently judge the case of the Alabama or\nthe Florida: Diligence to execute the law,\u2014vigilance\nto prevent its violation,\u2014is the same in Switzerland\nas in Italy or Brazil, in Great Britain or the United\nStates. And the position of Switzerland, which requires of her the spontaneous execution of her neutrality laws, had evident effect on the mind of Mr.\nStaernpfli to produce those conclusions of his against\nGreat Britain, which, as we shall see in the sequel,\nwere so grossly misapprehended and so angrily resented by Sir Alexander Cockburn.\nAt the time when the Swiss Government invited\nMr. Staernpfli to act as Arbitrator for Switzerland\nunder the Treaty.of Washington, he had full occupa-\ntion in public or private affairs as a member of the\nNational Council and as President of the Federal ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n83\n(Eidgenossische) Bank established at Berne. On\nreceiving the respective \"Counter-Cases\" of the two\nGovernments, which in effect closed the proofs on\nhoth sides, he took a characteristic step in order to\nbe prepared for action in June.\nAs you sail up the Lake of Thun toward Unter-\nseen or Interlaken, you note on the left the precipitous wooded mountain-side of Beatenberg. Here,\nhigh up in a rural hamlet, hidden among the trees,\nwith the beautiful lakes of Thun and Brienz at his\nfeet, and the magnificent spectacle of the Oberland,\nterminating at the remoter Berner Alps,\u2014in those\nbalmy Alpine days when spring is passing into summer, and all earth is a paradise of verdure and of animation,\u2014here Mr. Staernpfli secluded himself from the\nsocial distractions and cares of business at Berne, and\ndedicated himself to the mastery of the \"Alabama\nClaims.\" In such a blessed retreat even law-books\nmight lose their dullness, and diplomatic correspondence, depositions, and legal pleadings be invested with\nthe charmed reflection of the matchless scenery of\nlakes, fields, hanxlets, cities, mountains, and rivers,\nglittering in the sun, and resting in the horizon at\nCD CD' ' CD\nthe snow-crowned heights of the Jungfrau.\nAnd sp it seems to have been. For good St. Bea-\ntus blessed the mountain labors of Mr. Staernpfli, and\nhe came to Geneva in due time with full abstracts\nof evidence and elaborately written. opinions' on the\nmain questions at issue before the Tribunal, to the apparent surprise of Sir Alexander Cockburn, who, confidently relying on the rupture of the Arbitration, as\n%~- 84\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nhe himself avowed, had not yet begun to examine the\ncause, and seemed to suppose that every body else\nought to be as neglectfully ignorant of it as himself:\nwhich sentiment betrayed itself on various occasions\nin the sittings- of the Tribunal.\nVISCOUNT OF ITAJUBA.\nOn the left of Count Sclopis sat the Arbitrator\nnamed by the Emperor of Brazil, the Viscount of\nItajuba.\nThe people of the United States do not seem to be\ngenerally aware how much of high cultivation, especially [but not exclusively] in the departments of\ndiplomacy and jurisprudence, exists in those countries\nof America which were colonized by Spain and Portugal. Nevertheless, on careful consideration of the\nsterling merits of such historical writers as the Mexican Lucas Alaman,\u2014such authors of international jurisprudence as the Chilean Bello, the Argentine Calvo,\nor the Peruvian Pando,\u2014such writers of belles-lettres,\nof travels, or of statistics, as the Colombians Samper\nand Perez,\u2014such poets as the Brazilian Magalhaens,\n\u2014such codes of municipal law as those of the States\nof Cundinamarca and of Mexico or of the Argentine\nConfederation, and of other Republics of Spanish\nAmerica,\u2014we should be compelled to admit that literature and science are not confined to our part of\nthe New World.\nAnd, among all these new Powers of America, there\nis not one more deserving of respect,\u2014Empire and\nnot Republic though it be,\u2014than Brazil, in view of ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n85\nthe magnitude of its territory, the greatness of its resources, its military strength and successes, its enlightened and reforming chief ruler, the substantial liberality of its political institutions, and the unbroken\ndomestic tranquillity of its independent life, so strikingly in contrast with the revolutionary agitations of\nmost of the Spanish-American Republics.\nMarcos Antonio d'Araujo belongs to that numerous body of jurists and statesmen, the natural growth\nof parliamentary institutions based on popular election, who do honor at the present time to Brazil. He\nfilled in early life the chair of Professor of Jurisprudence in the University of Pernambuco. His first\ndiplomatic appointment was that of Consul-General\nof Brazil in the Hanse Towns, with residence at Hamburg. After that he held successively the offices of\nMinister or Envoy at Hanover, at Copenhagen, at\nBerlin, and finally at Paris. At the time of his appointment as Arbitrator he was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Brazil in France,\nby the title of Baron d'ltajuba, and he was made a\nViscount during the progress of the Arbitration.\nWith exception, therefore, of the judicial studies\nand occupations of his youth, the Viscount of Itajubd\nis a diplomatist, having passed nearly forty years of\nhis life in the discharge of diplomatic functions in\ndifferent countries of Europe. He possesses all the\nqualities of his career and station, namely, courteous\nand attractive manners, intelligence disciplined by long\nexperience of men and affairs,,instinctive appreciation\nof principles and facts, and the ready expression of\nI\u2014 &6\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthought in apt language, but without the tendency to\nrun into the path of debate or exposition, which appeared in the acts of some of his colleagues of the\nTribunal of Arbitration.\nIn comparing Mr. Staernpfli, with his deep-brown\ncomplexion, his piercing dark eyes, his jet black hair,\nhis quick but suppressed manner, and the Viscount\nof Itajubd, with his fair complexion and his air of\ngentleness and affability, one, having no previous\nknowledge of their respective origins, would certainly\nattribute that of the jbrmer to tropical and passionate America, and that of the latter to temperate and\ncalm-blooded Europe.\nSIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN.\nOn the extremes of the Board, Mr. Adams to the\nright and Sir Alexander Cockburn to the left, sat\nthe American and British members of the Tribunal.\nSir Alexander Cockburn represents a family of\nsome distinction, the Cockburns of Langton. His\nfather was British Minister in Colombia, and one of\nhis uncles was that Admiral Sir George Cockburn,\nwhose service in American waters during our last\nCD\nwar with Great Britain has left some unpleasant\ntraces or memories in the United States. His mother\nseems to have been a French lady, being described\nby Burke as \" Yolande, dau. of Viscomte de Vignier\nof St. Domingo.\" He was born in 1802, called to\nthe bar in 1829, became distinguished as a barrister,\nentered Parliament, and, after passing through the\nroutine offices of Solicitor and Attorney General, was ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n87\nmade Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas\nin 1856, and of the Queen's Bench in 1859, which\nplace he still fills.\nHe ^presided for sixteen years in the common-law\ncourts of England without being raised to the peerage. It is unnecessary to speculate on the xeasons\nfor this unusual, if not unprecedented fact.\nHis political career dates from his zealous defense\nof Lord Palmerston in the affair of the notorious\nDavid Pacifico. This person was an adventurer of\ndoubtful nationality and of bad character, in whose\nbehalf the navy of Great Britain, under Lord Palmer-\nston's direction, seized the Piraeus, captured Greek\nmerchant-vessels, and threatened Athens. The ground\nof claim was alleged destruction of property by a mob.\nPacifico claimed, according to the official statement of\nthe case by the British Government, \u00a34916 on ac-\ncount of furniture and other personal effects, which\nhe originally stated at only 5000 francs, and \u00a326,618\n16s. Sd. on account of papers. It is very doubtful\nwhether the claim was a proper subject of interna-,\ntional reclamation. But, after a three, months' blockade, Greece submitted to pay \u00a35000, of which \u00a34720\nwas either falsehood or consequential damages; and\nafterward, on examination of the case in Lisbon, a\ncommission awarded the petty sum of \u00a3150 in full\nsatisfaction of the pretended loss of \u00a326,618, induced\nperhaps by political reasons rather than by conviction\nof any rights of Pacifico.\nThe conduct of Lord Palmerston and the British\nGovernment in this affair nearly involved Great Brit- 88\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nain in a war with France and Russia. The French\nEmbassador retired from London to Paris for the\npurpose of personal communication on the subject\nwith his Government. Count Nesselrode on behalf\nof Russia remonstrated in a dispatch, which the London Times characterized as reproachful, irrefutable,\nand just, and as profoundly affecting the peace of Europe and the dignity of Great Britain. The united\nvoice of Europe and America has condemned the conduct of Great Britain in this affair. The House of\nLords closed an historic debate by a vote of censure\nof the Government. In the Commons, the last words\nof Sir Robert Peel were raised in protest against this\noutrage on the rights of other nations; the morn-\ning dawned on a protracted session of the House\nbefore he recorded his vote of condemnation; in the\nafternoon of the same day he met with the accident\nwhich closed his honorable life. Mr. Gladstone in the\nsame debate said that the claim was \"on the very face\nof it an outrageous fraud and falsehood;w that \"it\nwas mere falsehood and imposture,\" and that\" a greater iniquity had rarely been transacted under the face\nof the sun.\"\nSir Alexander Cockburn was then without parliamentary distinction or political advancement. With\nthe devotion of a Dalgetty, he placed his lance at\nthe service of a chief, regardless of the merits of the\ncause. He was soon rewarded for his services by\nappointment to the office of Solicitor-Genera], from\nwhich he was promoted step by step, with unexampled celerity, to his present position. ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n89\nSince he became the head of the Queen's Bench he\nhas occasionally appeared in the field of letters on\nquestions connected with municipal or public law, but\nnot in a way to invite respect at home, or attention\nbeyond the limits of Great Britain.\nA few years ago he published a monogram on the\nsubject of nationality, in which he reproduced in an\nabridged form [but quite incorrectly, as the remarks\nof a most competent judge, Mr. Beach Lawrence, on\ndroit cPaubaine, tend to show] the matter contained\nin the report of a commission appointed by the Government to inquire into and. report upon the laws of\nnaturalization and allegiance in England.\nAgain, when it was proposed to arraign Nelson and\nBrand as criminals in England for acts committed in\nCD\nJamaica under proclamation of martial law, Sir Alexander Cockburn delivered a voluminous charge to the\ngrand jury, which he afterward published with additions and notes, notwithstanding the partiality and the\nurgency of which, the grand jury refused to find a bill;\nand it must be confessed that, as a charge, it was passionate, vague, declamatory, and confused; and as an\nexposition of law, it is valueless when compared with\nthe treatises of Mr. Finlason, in England, and of Mr.\nWhiting, in America, on the same subject.\nThis charge, and some proceedings by which it\nwas followed, provoked much criticism. Mr. Ga-\nthorne Hardy, for instance, called attention to the\nfact that the Chief Justice \"vacillated,\" *that he\n\"went from one side to another,\" so as to render it\ndoubtful what his opinions really were; and Mr. 90\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nHardy, as well as Mr. Mill, who spoke on the other\nside of the general question, said that the charge was\n\" not law,\" and was \" without legal authority.\" Mr.\nFinlason, a most competent authority, said that,\" although the charge dealt so largely in denunciation,\"\nit was \"utterly indeterminate and indecisive;\" that\n\" it avowed a state of entire doubt;\" that, though\n\" there was much denunciation of law laid dow,a [by\nothers], there was no positive declaration of law laid\ndown by the Chief Justice.\" The same writer also\npoints out grave mistakes of history as well as errors\nof law in this charge. Thus, the Chief Justice assumes, as a cardinal thought, that martial law and\nmilitary law are one and the same thing: a mistake,\nwhich implies extraordinary confusion of mind, for-\ngetfulness of his own official opinions in the incidents of the rebellion in Ceylon, and ignorance of\nthe most commonplace events of English history, for\ninstance, as detailed in Hallam and Macaulay.\nI allude to these criticisms for the reason that, as\nwill appear in the sequel, the same singular intellectual traits and moral characteristics of the Chief Justice, which became conspicuous at Geneva, had shown\nthemselves on the Queen's Bench, and had attracted\nthe notice of his fellow-countrymen.\nI refer to this charge for another cause. It is diffi-\ncult for many reasons to measure the exact personal\nvalue of ordinary legal opinions delivered, in the\ncourse of adjudication, by any judge of the Queen's\nBench. All such difficulties cease when he goes out\nof his way to deliver a demonstrative charge to a ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n91\ngrand jury on one of the semi-political questions of\nthe day, and especially when such charge is carefully\nrevised for the Press, with additions and annotations\nby himself. Then we have the most satisfactory\nmeans  of estimating the  mental character of that\nCD\njudge. And such is the case here, to the effect of\nlowering greatly our estimation of the Chief Justice.\nA later incident in his judicial career also throws\nsome light on his character, and deserves notice in\nthis connection.\nWhen it was proposed to commence proceedings\nagainst Governor Eyre, growing out of what had\nbeen done in Jamaica under the same proclamation,\nMr. Justice Blackburn delivered a charge to the\ngrand jury, in the course of which he said: \"As to\nthe judges of my own court, the Lord Chief Justice,\nmy brother Mellor, my brother Lush, and my brother Hannen,. . . yesterday I stated to them the effect\nof what I am now stating to you, and they all approved of it, and authorized me to say,\u2014of course, not\nrelieving me from my responsibility, or absolutely\nbinding them, for of course they have not considered\nit so thoroughly and judicially as I have been\nobliged to do,\u2014still they authorize me to say they\nagree in my view of the law, and thought it right.\"\nA week later, when the case had been entirely dis-'\nposed of, the Chief Justice, while sitting on the\nBench, denied, with unseemly, warmth of language\nand manner, that he had assented to the law as laid\ndown by Mr. Justice Blackburn; but explained the\nalleged difference of opinion in  such obscure Ian- 92\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nguage as to render it scarcely intelligible. Mr. Justice Blackburn replied, reiterating in temperate language, his statement that the Chief Justice had- expressly assented ,to the legal doctrine of the charge,\nand his colleagues, Justices Mellor, Lush, and Han-\nnen, gave no support to the denial made by the Chief\nJustice.\nThe qualities of character exhibited in this incident were the occasion at the time of unfavorable\ncommentary on the part of the British Press and\npublic.\nSir Alexander Cockburn had seemed, on superficial view, a fit person to take part in the important\nduties committed to the Tribunal of Arbitration. He\ncarried thither the prestige of judicial rank, as the\nhead of one of the most venerable courts of Europe.\nAnd he was thorough master of the language in\n\u2022 CD ^D O\nwhich the discussions of the Tribunal were conducted.\nBut, unfortunately, it would seem that neither the\noriginal constitution of his mind, nor the studies, pursuits, or habits of his life, had fitted him for calm, impartial, judicial examination of great questions of\npublic law. The same traits of confused thought,\nequivocation in matters of law, tendency to declamatory denunciation of adversary opinions, which provoked and justified the criticisms of Mr. Finlason,\nMr. Gathorne Hardy, and others, and which prompted conflict with Mr. Justice Blackburn, reappeared\nin more vivid colors at Geneva.\nOf the offensive singularities of his deportment as ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n93\nArbitrator, we shall have but too much necessity to\nspeak in describing the acts of the Tribunal.\nMR. CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS.\nIn the American Arbitrator, Mr. Charles Francis\nAdams, the Tribunal had a member worthy of the\ncompanionship of Count Frederic Sclopis.\nIn the United States, persons have been found so\nfoolish as to reproach Mr. Adams because of the historical eminence of his father and of his grandfather,\nand even because of the intelligence and cultivation\nof his sons: as if it were a crime in a Republic for a\nfather to have a good son, or a son a good father, or\nto live in the holy atmosphere of a succession of wise\nand virtuous mothers.\nBesides, if it be meritorious to rise to distinction\nfrom lowliness and poverty, it is not less so to resist\nand overcome the obstacles to personal distinction\ncreated by parental station or wealth. In this, which\nis the only correct view of the subject, all men are\nself-made. The attributes of Mr. Charles Francis\nAdams are his own: distinguished parliamentary career in the Legislature of the State of Massachusetts\nand in the Congress of the United States,\u2014literary\nmerits of a high order as displayed in his \" Life and\nWritings of John Adams,\"\u2014able diplomatic representation of his Government in Great Britain during\nthe whole dark period of our Civil War. He possessed qualities, acquirements, and experience, general\nand special, which seemed to invite his appointment\nas American Arbitrator; and in the discharge of the 94\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nduties of the office he did honor to the Tribunal and\nto the United States.\nThe deportment of Mr. Adams as a member of the\nTribunal was unexceptionably dignified, manly, courteous, even when compelled on more than one occasion to notice rude acts or words of Sir Alexander\nCockburn. While $he conduct of the latter was too\nfrequently on the comparatively low plane of the nisi\nprius attorney of a party before a court, the conduct\nof the former was uniformly on the higher one of a\nmember of the court and a iudge. Hence, in the\nsame degree that the personal influence of Mr. Adams,\nby reason of his recognized impartiality and integrity,\nwas beneficial to the United States, on the other hand,\nthe influence of Sir Alexander Cockburn, by reason\nof his petulant irritability and unjudicial partisanship\nof action, was unfavorable to Great Britain.\nSuch, then, were the Arbitrators representing the\nfive Governments.\nSECRETARY OF THE TRIBUNAL.\nTheir Secretary, Mr. Alexandre Favrot, was a gentlemanly person of literary attainments and profession, actually residing in Berne, but born in the\nFrench-speaking Canton of Neuchatel,\" who had become perfectly acquainted with the English language\nby a sojourn of several years in England. \u2022\nAGENTS AND COUNSEL.\nThe Agents of the two Governments, Lord Tenter-\nden and Mr.Bancroft Davis, were peculiarly qualified ALABAMA CLAIMS.\nfor the places they filled, both of them having served\nin similar capacities in the foreign Department of\ntheir respective Governments, and both having assisted in the negotiation of the Treaty of Washington.\nTheir friendly personal relations were advantageous\nin facilitating the movement of business before the\nCD\nArbitration.\nMr. Bancroft Davis deserves particular mention.\n'Englishmen may criticise the American 1 Case,\" the\nlabor of preparing which devolved chiefly on him\nbut its indisputable merit should draw to him the\napplause of every American. His literary accomplishments, his previous diplomatic experience, his\nknowledge of men and things in Europe, and his devoted and untiring attention to the public interests,\nwere singularly useful to the United States.\nOf the persons or qualities of the Counsel of the\nUnited States, Mr. Morrison R. Waite, Mr. William\nM. Evarts, and the writer of this exposition, it would\nbe unbecoming, as it is quite superfluous, here to\nspeak.\nIn this relation, however, it is proper to call attention to two facts or incidents of national interest or\nconcernment.\nIn the first place, to the honor of the President of\nthe United States be it said', in the selection of Counsel by him, as for instance in the invitation to Mr. B.\nR. Curtis, considerations of party were not allowed to\nexert controlling authority.\nSecondly, the Counsel themselves emulated the\ncatholic spirit of the President in subordinating all \u25a0\u25a0I\n96\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\npersonal considerations to the single object of winning a great cause, the greatest ever committed to the\nO O * CD\ncharge of members of the Bar, and pending in the\nhighest court ever organized, namely, the suit of\nthe United States against Great Britain before the\nTribunal of Arbitration. Although diverse in their\nhabits of mind, and in their lines of experience and\naction, they acted as a unit in the determination of\nadvice to be given from time to time to the Govern-\nment or its Agent;\u2014in the preparation of the printed\nArgument required by the Treaty, a document of five\nhundred pages, to be signed by them jointly;\u2014and in\nthe subsequent preparation of a number of joint or\nseparate Arguments in compliance with the requirements of the Arbitrators. We may appeal to those\nArguments as the tangible proof, at any rate, of our\nconcurrent and united dedication, during nine months\nof continuous and solicitous thought or labor, to the\ndischarge of our duty to our Government and our\ncountry, as Counsel under the Treaty of Washington.\nSir Roundell Palmer alone appeared before the\nTribunal as eo nomine Counsel of Great Britain; but\nMr. Mountague Bernard, elevated to the office of a\nlaw-member of the Queen's Council, sat by his side at\nthe Counsels' table, and also Mr. Cohen. The hand\nof the latter was apparent in the estimates and exhibits presented to the Tribunal to guide them in the\ndetermination of the damages to be awarded to the\nUnited States.\nThe recent promotion of Sir Roundell Palmer to\nthe pre-eminent post of Lord Chancellor, by the title ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n97\nof Lord Selborne, is the appropriate consummation of\na professional and parliamentary career of distinguished ability and of unstained honor. In conducting the deliberations of the House of Lords; in presiding over the High Court of Chancery; in participating in the affairs of the Cabinet; in guiding the\nconscience of the Queen through the embarrassments\nwhich now beset the English Church, we may be sure\nthat Lord Selborne will join to the high authority of\na skillful debater and a learned jurist the still higher\nauthority of a sincerely conscientious statesman, so as\nto add incontestable force to Mr. Gladstone's Ministry.\nAnd all that authority, we may confidently assume,\nwill be used in the promotion or maintenance of\namicable relations between Great Britain and the\nUnited States.\nThis account of the personnel of the Arbitration\nwould be imperfect without mention of the younger\nbut estimable persons who constituted the staff of\nthe formal representatives of the two Governments,\nnamely: on the part of the United States, Mr. C. C.\nBeaman, as solicitor, and Messrs. Brooks Adams, John\nDavis, F.W.Hackett,W.F.Pedrick, and Edward T.\nWaite, as secretaries; and on the part of Great Britain, in the latter capacity or as translators, Messrs.\nSanderson,Mafkheim,Villiers,Langley, and Hamilton.\nIf the labors of these gentlemen were less conspicuous\nthan those of the Agents and Counsel, they were\nscarcely less indispensable; and they all deserve a\nplace in the history of the Arbitration.\nA single observation will close up these personal\nG\nm    \u25a0 98\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nsketches, and bring us to the consideration of the ulterior proceedings of the Tribunal.\nOccasionally, but not frequently, at the present day,\nwe hear in the United States ungracious suggestions\ntouching the personal deportment of Englishmen. No\nsuch observations, it is certain, are justified by any experience of the city of Washington. The eminent\npersons, who, in- the present generation, have represented the British Government here, whether in permanent or special missions, such as Sir Richard Pack-\nenham, Lord Napier, Lord Lyons, Sir Frederick Bruce,\nand Sir Edward Thornton, of the former class, and\nLord Ashburton, the Earl of Elgin, Earl De Grey,\nSir Stafford Northcote, Mr. Mountague Bernard, Sir\nJohn A. Macdonald, and Lord Tenterden, of the latter\nclass, with the younger persons of their respective\nsuites, and so many others who have visited this city,\nwere unmistakably and with good cause popular with\nthe Americans. Indeed, it is rather in Continental\nEurope, and especially in France, and \"by no means\nin the United States, that overbearingness or un-\ncourteous deportment toward others is regarded as a\ntrait of Englishmen.\nAnd it is agreeable to remember that, of the ten\nEnglishmen with \"whom we of the United States came\nin daily contact at Geneva, and sometimes in circumstances of contentious attitude of a nature to produce\ncoolness at least, all but one. were uniformly and un-\nexceptionally courteous in act and manner,\u2014and that\none Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench.\nI - a holder of the office of Chief Justice emanci- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n99\npated from all social bonds? It is not so with Chief\nJustices in America; nor was it so in former days in\nGreat Britain, according to my recollection of the\ngreat judges, the Eldons, the Tenterdens, and the\nStowells, who then presided over the administration\nof the common law, and of the equity and admiralty\njurisprudence of England. Has the human race there\ndegenerated ? I think not: no possible judicial tenure of office could transform or deform a Roundell\nPalmer into an Alexander Cockburn.\nEFFORTS OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO OBTAIN\nREARGUMENT.\nThe Tribunal and the persons attending it are now\nbefore us, and we resume its proceedings at the point\nwhere we left them, namely, the session of the 27th\nof June, at the close of the address of Count Sclopis.\nThe \"Argument,\" filed\" in behalf of the United\nStates on the 15th of June, was prepared and delivered in strict conformity with the stipulations of the\nTreaty. It was, in effect, the closing argument on the\nwhole case, consisting of an abridged view of the facts\no CD\non both. sides as presented in their \" Cases\" and\n\" Counter-Cases,\" with appropriate discussion of the\nquestions of law which the claims of the United States\ninvolved. We followed the ordinary routine of judicial controversy,\" and the course of common-sense and\nof necessity, in giving a complete resume of our Case\nin the final \" Argument,\" as contemplated and prescribed by the Treaty.\nThe \"Case\" and \"Counter-Case\" of each side had 100\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nsufficiently indicated the scope of inquiry or debate,\nand defined its limits. Within those limits all pertinent law, history, and reason lay at the command of\nthe Counsel of the United States, as of those of Great\nBritain. If we, the Counsel of the United States, had\nneglected at the proper time to avail ourselves of the\ngreat stores of knowledge and of reason accessible to\nus, we could not expect to .supply the deficiencies of\nour \"Argument\" by filing a new one as the means of\nresponse to, and commentary on, the .British \"Argument.\" Such procedure was not authorized,\u2014it was\nplainly forbidden,\u2014by the Treaty.\nIt avails nothing to say that the course prescribed\nby the Treaty is unumal: such was' the will of the\ntwo Governments. \"Doubtless they had good reasons,\nand among them, perhaps, was the very purpose of\nnot having final \"Arguments,\"\u2014that is, the third argument in effect on both sides,\u2014consist of a mere debate\nof reply and rejoinder betwixt Counsel.\nGreat Britain had no cause or excuse for misapprehension in this respect, although both Government\nand Counsel had, it is true, fallen into the careless\nway of speaking of the \" Summary \" to be filed on the\n15.th of June. Nay, the paper filed by Great Britain\nis expressly entitled \"Argument or Summary? If\nargument and summary are synonymous terms, then\nit is tautology and bad taste to employ them both to\ndesignate the same document. If they mean different\nthings, then it is misleading to employ the term summary at all; for summary is not the language nor the\niserise of the Treaty.   The Treaty requires each Agent ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n101\nto deliver \" a written or printed argument showing\nthe points and referring to the evidence upon which\nhis Government relies.\" Do these words imply a\nweak or imperfect argument? Do they define the\nnumber of pages to be occupied ? Do they require\neither of the parties to leave out his strong points ?\nOf course not. And if the Treaty said \" summary,\"\n\u2014which it does not,\u2014who shall say what is a fit summary of some twenty volumes of evidence and of legal\ndiscussions, such as the two \"Cases\" and \"Counter-\nCases\" comprehend? The United States had the\nright to iudge for themselves .what exhibition of\nCD O CD w\n\" points \" and what \" evidence \" to submit to the Arbitrators.\nThe British Government must have been dissatisfied, with its own argument. That is clear, and is the\nonly sufficient explanation of the earnest and persistent efforts of Sir Roundell Palmer to obtain permission to reargue the cause. There was no misapprehension on the part of the British Government as to\nthe more or less fullness of argumentation admissible\nin the so-called \"Argument;\" for there is notable\nsimilitude in this respect on both Bides in the introductory language of the final \"Arguments\" of the\n\u2022f CD CD CD\ntwo Governments. We believed at the time, and all\nthe subsequent occurrences tended to prove, that as\nthe British Government had underestimated the force\nof our cause until the \" Case \" came into their hands,\nso they did not appreciate the amplitude of our law\nand our evidence until they read our \" Argument.\"\nAnd strange, almost incredible, though it be, the 102\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nBritish Government would seem to have supposed\nthat the United States were to discuss and confute\nthe British \" Counter-Case\" in the American \" Counter-\nCase ;\" that is, to make reply to an elaborate argument on the law-and the facts [for such is the British\n\"Counter-Case\" ] without seeing it or possessing any\nknowledge of its contents. Manifestly, no complete\nand systematic final \"Argument\" on the part of the\nUnited States was possible without previous thoughtful knowledge of the British \" Counter-Case.\" And\nyet Sir Roundell Palmer, in expressing desire to an-\nswer our \"Argument,\" reasoned expressly on the implication that it ought to have been \"a.mere complement of previous documents? No such idea certainly\nis conveyed by the Treaty; and the implication is\ncontrary to reason and the Very nature of things.\nSir Roundell Palmer entered on the question the\nmoment it became reasonably certain that the Arbitration would proceed. On the 29th of June he proposed to us, informally, to arrange for reargument of\nthe cause, he to have until the end of the first week\nof August to prepare his Argument, and we to the\nend of August to prepare a reply. The effect of this\nwould be a suspension of the sittings for more than\nten weeks, and a prolongation to that extent [and\nperhaps much more] of the absence of the American\nArbitrator, Agent, and Counsel from their country.\nIn other respects the proposition involved much inequality; for it would have given to the British\nCounsel nearly six weeks at his own home in London,\nwith books, assistants, translators, and printing-offices ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n103\nat his command,\u2014in a word, the whole force of the\nBritish Government at his back, in which to write\nand print his Argument; while it would have afforded\nto the American Counsel less than four weeks for the\nsame task, in which to prepare and print our Argument in both.languages, with no libraries at hand, no\ntranslators,-no printers, thrown wholly on our personal resources away from home in the heart of Europe.\nThe Counsel of the United States desired no reargument of the cause. We found nothing in the\nBritish Argument which we had not anticipated and\ndisposed of to our own satisfaction. Not that we\nfeared reargument: on the contrary, we felt such complete confidence in our rights as to be sure not to lose,\nand to hope rather to gain, by. further discussion.\nHence we did not desire nor seek reargument, although perfectly ready for it if called.upon in conformity with the Treaty. Our objections were to the\ndelay and to the departure from the conditions of the\nTreaty.\nAccording to the explicit language of the Treaty,\n\" the decision of the Tribunal shall, if possible,- be\nmade Within three months from the close of the arguments on both sides;\" and the prescribed day \" for\nthe close of the arguments on both sides \" is the 15th\nCD\nof June. Suppose that, by agreement of the two. Governments,\u2014it could not be done by Counsel without\nconsent of their Governments;\u2014\"the close of the\narguments\" had been postponed to the 31st of August, as proposed by Sir Roundell Palmer.   In that\n%\u2014 104\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nevent the Arbitrators could not in reason or decency\nhave commenced their deliberations until the 1st of\nSeptember; they might well have taken, as they did\nin fact take, three months to complete their deliberations; and thus the Arbitrators and the American\nCounsel [but not the English] would have been detained at Geneva until the 1st of December, and therefore would not have been able to reach their homes\nuntil January.\nBut the reargument proposed by Sir Roundell\nPalmer was contrary to the Treaty, which, in express\nterms closes the rights of the two Governments as to\nhearing; and admits further discussion on their part\nonly at the requisition of the Arbitrators, \" if they\ndesire further elucidation in regard to any point.\"\n[Art. V.] Which manifestly intends, not reargument\nof the cause, but solution of any doubt, which, after the\ncompletion of the arguments, may occur to the Tribunal. No consent of Counsel could annul the stipulations of the Treaty.\nOf course, for reasons of right as* well as expediency, we declined to accede to the proposition of Sir\nRoundell Palmer.\nNevertheless, at the meeting of the 27th, immediately after the conclusion of Count Sclopis's discourse,\nLord Tenterden presented a motion on the part of\nSir Roundell Palmer for leave to file a written argu-\nCD\nment in answer to the Argument of the United States\ndelivered on the 15th, and requesting adjournment\nfor that purpose until August. Sir Roundell Palmer\nread a brief of the points he desired to argue, which ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n105\ncovered in effect all the points of the American i Case \"\nand \" Argument,\"\u2014that is to say, it implied a complete reargument of the whole cause. It amounted\nto assuming or admitting that no sufficient or proper\ndefense had yet been made by the British Government.\nWe, in behalf of the United States, proceeded to\nprepare a reply to this motion. We took it up\npoint by point, and showed by citation of pages that\nevery one of the proposed points had been* largely\nand amply discussed already by Great Britain in her\nI Case,\" \" Counter-Case,\" and \" Argument;\" that nothing new could be said on these points; and that, in\nfact, the very object proposed was to reiterate arguments already adduced, but to do it in the inadmissible form of mere criticism of the American Argument. And we cited the Treaty .to show that the\ndiscussion proposed was contrary to the explicit contract of the two Governments.\nMeanwhile the Tribunal proceeded to decide, on\nsuggestion of Mr. Adams, that the proposed argument\nwas inadmissible, and that Counsel had no right to\naddress the Tribunal unless required by it so to do\nfor the elucidation of any point under the 5th article\nof the Treaty.\nAt the next meeting of the Tribunal, on the 28th,\nSir Alexander Cockburn presented a list of eight\npoints covering in effect the points of the. rejected\nmotion of Sir Roundell Palmer, and moved that the\nTribunal require of the Counsel of the two Governments written or printed arguments on the said points; 106\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nbut the Tribunal decided not at present to require\nsuch arguments.\nWhether the motion of Sir Alexander Cockburn\nwas prompted by Sir Roundell Palmer, in order to\nafford to.the latter the desired opportunity to criticise the American \" Argument,\"\u2014or whether it was\na spontaneous one arising from the former's not having studied the case, and his consequent ignorance of\nthe fact that most of the questions proposed had already been* amply and sufficiently discussed by both\nGovernments,\u2014does not distinctly appear. Probably both motives co-operated to induce the motion.\nSubsequent incidents throw some light on this point.\nMeanwhile it was plain to infer from the observations of the other Arbitrators, and from their decision, that they were better informed on the subject\nthan Sir Alexander Cockburn.\nRULES CONCERNING THE CONFERENCES OF THE TRIBUNAL.\nThe Tribunal next decided that the Agents should\nattend all the discussions and deliberations of the\nConferences, accompanied by the Counsel, except in\ncase where the Tribunal should think it advisable to\nconduct their discussions and deliberations with closed\ndoors. The practical effect of this resolution, when\nconnected with a resolution adopted at a subsequent\nmeeting in regard to the course of proceeding, was to\nenable and require the Agents and Counsel to assist\nat the judicial consultations of the Tribunal: it being\nunderstood, of course, that none others should be present save the representatives of the two Governments. ALABAMA CLAIMS.\nThe Tribunal then authorized publicity to be given\nto its declaration and to the declarations of the two\nGovernments, relative to the national claims of the\nUnited States: after which it adjourned to the 15th\nof July.\nHeretofore, either by intimation to the Secretary,\nand to the Agents and Counsel, or by formal resolution, the Tribunal had signified its desire that the\nproceedings should not be committed to publicity,\nunless by the will of the respective Governments.\nOf course, reporters for the Press, and other persons\nnot officially connected with the Arbitration, were excluded from the sittings of the Tribunal. This reserve or secrecy of proceeding was inconvenient to\nthe many respectable representatives of the Press of\nLondon and New York, persons of consideration, who\nhad come to Geneva for the purpose of satisfying the\npublic curiosity of the United States and of England\nregarding the acts of the Tribunal; but was dictated,\nit would seem, rather by considerations of delicacy\ntoward the two Governments, than by any reluctance\non the part of the Arbitrators to have their action\nmade known day by day to the world. It was a tribunal of peculiar constitution and character; its\nmembers were responsible in some sense each to his\nown Government, and also to the opinion, at least, of\nthe litigant Governments; its proceedings were not\npurely judicial, but in a certain degree- diplomatic;\nand a large part of the proceedings were in the nature not so much of action as of judicial consultation,\nwhich it might well seem unfit to communicate to the 108\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ngeneral public as they occurred, although perfectly fit\nto be thus communicated to the respective Governments.\nThe Tribunal reassembled on the 15th of July.\nDown to this time all the proceedings of the Arbitrators were in their nature public acts, or they have\nbeen made public through the respective Governments.   All such acts were recorded in the protocols.\nHereafter, we shall have, in addition to the acts of\nthe Tribunal recorded in protocols, a series of provisional opinions, which were also printed and distributed [or should have been] according to express\norder of the Tribunal. These opinions of the Arbitrators, as well as their official acts, have already been\nmade public by both Governments.\nBut, incidentally to such acts and opinions, there\nwas much oral debate from time to time at the successive Conferences of the Tribunal. At these debates, the Agents and Counsel of both Governments\nwere required to assist, by resolution of the Tribunal.\nAssisting, we necessarily heard what was said by the\nrespective Arbitrators. We were expected to hear,\nit is presumable, and also to understand: otherwise,\nwhy required to attend ?\nAre these debates, which occurred in the presence\nof so many persons^ Agents, Counsel, and others, to be\nregarded as confidential and unfit to be disclosed now?\nForget them, we can not, even if copious notes of the\nmost important debates did not exist to aid and correct mere memory. Is it, then, improper to speak of\nthem ?   I think not.    I conceive that any of us, who ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n109\npossess knowledge of those debates, have perfect fight\nto refer to them on all fit occasions.\n* I propose, however, on the present occasion, to exercise this right sparingly, and that only in two relations, namely, first, very briefly, where such reference\ninvolves mere formality, and is almost inseparable\nfrom acts recorded in the protocols; and, secondly,\nwith a little more fullness at the close, and with some\nretrospection, for the purpose of explaining the final\nact of the British Arbitrator.\nDISCUSSIONS OF THE TRIBUNAL.\nAt the meeting of the 15th, discussion arose immediately as to the method and order of proceeding to\nbe adopted in the consideration of the subjects referred to the Tribunal.\nMr. Staernpfli then suggested that in his opinion the\nproper course was to take up the case of some vessel,\nas expressly required by the Treaty, and consider\nwhether on that vessel Great Britain was responsible\nto the United States. He had directed his own inquiries in this way, and in this way had arrived at\nsatisfactory conclusions. His plan had been to select\na vessel,\u2014to abstract the facts proved regarding her,\n\u2014and then to apply to the facts the special rules of\nthe Treaty.\nDebate on this' proposition ensued between Sir\nAlexander Cockburn, on the one hand, and the rest\nof the Arbitrators on the other hand; the former desiring to have preliminary consideration of \" principles,\" that is, of abstract questions of law, and the lat- 110\n-THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nter insisting that the true and logical course was that\nCD CD\nof the Treaty, namely, to take. up a case, to examine\nthe facts, and to discuss and apply the law .to the\nfacts thus ascertained, as proposed by Mr. Staernpfli.\nFinally it was concluded, on the proposition of\nCount Sclopis, to follow \"substantially the programme\nof Mr. Staernpfli, that is, to take up the inculpated vessels, seriatim, each Arbitrator to express an opinion\nin writing thereon, of such tenor as he should see fit,\nbut these opinions to he provisional only for the present, and not to conclude the Arbitrator, or to prevent\nhis modifying such opinion, on arriving at the point\nof participation in the final decision of the Tribunal.\nOn the 16th, consideration of the programme of\nMr. Staernpfli was resumed. It consisted of the following heads, which deserve to be set forth here, in\norder to show! how thoroughly the subject had been\nexamined and digested by Mr. Staernpfli.\n\" (A.) Indications generates:\n1. Question a decider.\n2. Delimitation des fa its.\n3. Principes geneVaux.\n\" (B.)

Determination du Tribunal d'adjuger unc somme en bloc.\n\" (IX) Examen des elements pour fixer uue somme en bloc.\n\" (E.) Conclusion et adjudication definitive d'une somme en\nbloc.\" ALABAMA CLAIMS.\nIll\nThe completeness and exactness of this programme\nare self-evident; and by these qualities it really imposed itself on the Tribunal, in spite of all objection,\nand of occasional temporary departures into other\nlines of thought.    There will be occasion hereafter\nCD\nto remark on the precision and concision of the opinions of Mr. Staernpfli.\nSIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S CALL FOR REARGUMENT.\nSir Alexander Cockburn then renewed his proposition for a preliminary argument by Counsel, setting forth analytically the various objects of inquiry\ninvolved in the claims of the United States, and concluding as follows:\nCD\n\" That, looking to the difficulty of these questions, and the\nconflict of opinion which has arisen among distinguished jurists on the present contest, as well as to their vast importance\nin the decision of the Tribunal on the matters in dispute, it is\nthe duty, as it must be presumed to be the wish, of the Arbitrators, in the interests of justice, to obtain all the assistance\nin their power to enable them to arrive at a just and correct\nconclusion. That they ought, therefore, to call for the assistance of the eminent counsel who are in attendance on the Tribunal to assist them with their reasoning and learning, so that\narguments scattered over a mass of documents may be presented in a concentrated and appreciable form, and the Tribunal may thus have the advantage of all the light which can be\nthrown on so intricate and difficult a matter, and that its proceedings may hereafter appear to the world to have been characterized by the patience, the deliberation, and anxious desire\nfor information on all the points involved in its decision, without'which it is impossible-that justice can be duly or satisfactorily done.\"\n\" To obtain all the assistance in their power to en- 112\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nable them to arrive at a just and correct conclusion,\"\n\u2014\" to call for the assistance of the eminent counsel\nwho are in attendance on the Tribunal to assist them\nwith their reasoning and learning.\"\nO CD\nAnalyzing the proposition, and omitting the introductory and concluding phrases of more or less irrelevant and diffuse appeal to extraneous considerations, the essence of the proposition is to call on\nCounsel to assist the Tribunal, \" so that arguments\nscattered over a mass of documents may be presented\nin a concentrated and appreciable form.\"\nNow, passing over the looseness and inaccuracy of\nexpression in this statement, it plainly is incorrect in\nsubstance. The considerations of law or fact necessary for the instruction of the Tribunal are not \"scattered over a mass of documents;\" they are \" presented\nin a concentrated . .. form\" [We do not say appreciable, because that is not a quality intelligible as applied to form] in the three arguments of each of the\nGovernments,\u2014that is to say, \" Cases,\" \" Counter-\nCases,\" and \" Arguments.\" The proposition betrays\nsingular confusion of mind on the part of a nisiprius\nlawyer and judge. The subjects or elements of argument are, it is true, \" scattered over a mass of documents ;\" but it is quite absurd to apply this phrase\nto the Arguments themselves, in which the two Governments had each labored, we may suppose, to exhibit their views of the law and the facts in a manner to be readily comprehended and appreciated by\nthe Tribunal. In the Arguments proper, filed on the\n15th of June, each Agent had, as the Treaty requires, ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n113\ndelivered \" to each of the said Arbitrators and to the\nAgent of the other party a written or printed argument showing the points and referring to the evidence on which his Government relies.\" These \" Arguments \" were freshly in the possession of the Arbitrators. To call on Counsel, for the reason assigned,\nto reargue the matters therein argued, was just as\nunreasonable as it would be for a judge presiding at\na hearing in common law, equity, or admiralty, to\ncall on the counsel, who have just finished their arguments, to do something for the \"assistance\" of the\nCourt,\u2014it would be difficult to see what,\u2014to the end\n\" that arguments scattered over a mass of documents\nmay be presented in a concentrated and appreciable\nform.\" And if in this case such arguments had been\nfiled in print, it would be natural for counsel to say\nthat they had just done the thing required of them,\nas the Court would perceive if it would please to\nread those arguments: which, in the present case, it\nwould seem, Sir Alexander had-neglected to do; and,\ninstead of doing it, he had got bewildered by plunging unpreparedly into the \" mass of documents\" filed\nby the two Governments.\nAfter discussion, the Tribunal decided to proceed\nwith the case of the Florida, according to the programme of Mr. Staernpfli, that is, in effect, overruling\nthe motion of Sir Alexander Cockburn.\nThe Tribunal, it would seem, could not perceive\nthe advantage of discussing speculative general ques-\ntionsj as in a moot court; and, more especially, questions of law, which had already been discussed abun-\nH 114\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ndantly in the appropriate place and time, that is, in\nthe successive Cases and Arguments of the two Governments.\nCASE OF THE \"FLORIDA\" DECIDED.\nThe Arbitrators then met on the 17th, and proceeded to take up the case of the Florida.\nOn motion of Sir Alexander Cockburn, it was ordered by the Tribunal that the provisional opinions or\nstatements to be read by the Arbitrators should be\nprinted, and distributed to the Arbitrators and to the\nAgents and Counsel of the two Governments.\nMr. Staempfli's opinion or statement had been read\nalready, and was in print.\nAfter some incidental discussion among the Arbi-\ntrators, Sir A. Cockburn began the reading of his\n7 O CD\nopinion on the case of the Florida.\nThe Tribunal met again on the 19th, and Sir Alex:\nander Cockburn proceeded to read another portion of\nhis opinion in the case of the Florida.\nThen, after4some debate, caused Joy irregularities of\nspeech or conduct on the part of Sir Alexander, Mr.\nAdams proceeded to read the commencement of his\nopinion in the matter of the Florida.\nOn the 2 2d, the case of the Florida was concluded.\nSir Alexander Cockburn and Mr. Adams completed\nthe reading of their opinions, and the Baron d'ltajuba\nand Count Sclopis both read theirs. The result was\nto convict Great Britain of culpable want of due\ndiligence in the matter of the Florida by the concurrent provisional opinions of four of the Arbitra- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n115\ntors, with a dissenting opinion from the British\" Arbitrator.\nThe Florida, it will be remembered, was a steam\ngun-boat, built at Liverpool by Miller & Sons, on\ncontract with the Confederate agent Bullock, for the\nwarlike use of the Confederates. Miller & Sons.\nfalsely pretended that she was being built for the\nItalian Government by arrangement with Messrs.\nThomas & Brothers of Liverpool and Palermo, one of\nwhom expressly and fraudulently confirmed the false\nrepresentation of Miller & Sons. The British Government, although repeatedly warned of the illegal\ncharacter of this vessel by the diplomatic and consular authorities of the United States, shut its eyes\nto the transparent falsehood and fraud of Miller &\nSons and of Thomas, and took no proper and sufficient measures to investigate her character and to\nCD\nprevent the violation of the laws of the kingdom.\nShe sailed from Liverpool without obstruction, cleared\nby the name of Oreto, unarmed, it is true, but accompanied by another vessel containing her armament, called the JBahama.\nThe Orebo next makes her appearance at Nassau,\nwhere she proceeded further to equip and arm.as a\nman-of-war. The naval authorities at Nassau were\nunanimous in denouncing her illegal character, but\nthe civil authorities, perverted by their sympathies,\ncould with difficulty be persuaded to act against her.\nWhen they did act, she was acquitted by the local\nAdmiralty Court, in the teeth of the facts and the\nlaw, either corruptly, or with inexplicable ignorance 116\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nof their duty on the part of the Court and of the\nattorney representing the Government.    No appeal,\nwas taken by the Government.\nThe Oreto then threw off all pretensions of innocence; she openly completed her equipment, armament, and crew, partly at one place and partly at another, under the eye of the colonial authorities; and\nproceeded to cruise and to make prizes as an avowed\nman-of-war by the name of Florida. Meanwhile, with\nthe illegality of her operations in England, and also\nin the Bahama Islands, now notorious and admitted,\nshe continued to come and. go in British ports, and to\nobtain supplies there as her base of operations, without\ninterference on the part of the British Government.\n1 On these facts, the three neutral Arbitrators and\nMr. Adams convicted the British Government of want\nof due diligence, and of disregard otherwise of the\nRules of the Treaty, notwithstanding that the Florida\nhad entered and remained some time in the Confederate port of Mobile.\nTheir several opinions were precise, definite, clear,\nand with positive conclusion, as to all the material\npoints of the case, in favor of the United States.\nSir Alexander Cockburn's adverse opinion was a\nverbose special plea,\u2014which, while admitting all the\nmaterial facts charged, and conceding the palpable\nfraud practiced by Miller & Sons and Thomas,\u2014the\noriginal guilt of the vessel,\u2014the absurdity of the action of the Admiralty Court of Nassau,\u2014the illegal\nequipments at Nassau and elsewhere in British ports,\n\u2014and the continued use of British ports as a base of ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n117\noperations,\u2014could not discover in these incidents any\nnegligence or any violation of neutrality on the part\nof the British Government. Sir Alexander chose not\nto remember that the affair of the Oreto or Florida\nwas, from the beginning to the end, according to the\nconfession of Lord John Russell, himself, a scandal\nand a reproach to the laws of Great Britain, and still\nmore, we may add, a scandal and a reproach, to certain of the British Ministers, of whose honor Sir Alexander assumes to be the special champion.\nWhen Count Sclopis had concluded the reading of\nhis opinion, Sir Alexander Cockburn renewed his motion for the hearing of Counsel; but was again overruled by the Tribunal, which assigned for its next\nConference the consideration of the case of the Alabama.\nSPECIAL ARGUMENTS  ORDERED ON CERTAIN POINTS.\nThe Tribunal met again on the 25th; and the Baron d'ltajubd, then made a precise and formal proposition, calling on the Counsel of Great Britain for a\n/ CD\nwritten or printed Statement or Argument in elucidation of three questions of law, namely:\n\" 1. The question of due diligence treated in a general manner.\n\" 2. The effect of commissions possessed by Confederate vessels of war which had entered into British ports.\n13. The supplies of coal furnished to Confederate vessels in\nBritish ports.\"\nAnd with liberty to the Counsel of the United States\nto reply either orally or in writing as the case may be.\nThis proposition was adopted by the Tribunal. 118\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nIn so far as regards the first point, the call for Argument was obviously induced by a desire to put an\nend to the unseemly importunities of Sir Alexander .\nCockburn; for the Arbitrators had in effect again\nand again declared that in their judgment there was\nno occasion for elucidation or further discussion of\nthe general question of due diligence; that the Tribunal did not desire any theoretical discussions of\nabstract questions; and that the practical question\nof due diligence had been already discussed to satiety\nin the several Cases and Arguments filed by the respective Governments. We shall perceive in the sequel how well-founded were the objections of the Tribunal in this respect; and how devoid of any useful\nobject or purpose had been the ill-digested calls of\nSir Alexander Cockburn.\nTo the other questions propounded by the Baron\nd'Itajub&, no objection could be made: they were fit\nsubjects of the \"elucidation\" contemplated by the\nTreaty.\nCASE OF THE \"ALABAMA\" DECIDED.\nThe Arbitrators then proceeded to read alphabetically their opinions in the case of the Alabama,\u2014-that\nis to say, Mr. Adams, Sir Alexander Cockburn, Count\nSclopis, and Mr. Staernpfli read argumentative statements at length, and the Baron d'ltajuba expressed\nhis concurrence in the statement made by Sir Alexander Cockburn.\nIn this case the Arbitrators were unanimously of\nopinion, \u2014 the British Arbitrator equally with his ALABAMA CLAIMS.-\n119\ncolleagues,\u2014that the British Government had been\nguilty of culpable want of the due diligence required,\neither by the law of nations, the Rules of the Treaty,\nor Act of Parliament.\nIn fact, this vessel had been built and fitted out in\nGreat Britain in violation of her laws, with intent to\ncarry on war against the United States; evidence of\nthis fact had been submitted, sufficient, in the opinion\nof the Law Officers of the Crown, to justify her detention ; notwithstanding which, by reason of absence\nof due vigilance, and not without suspicion of connivance on the part of public officers, and with extraordinary delay in issuing necessary orders, she was suffered to go unmolested out of the immediate jurisdiction of the British Government. Her armament, supplies, and crew were all procured from Great Britain.\nAnd, in like violation of law, she was received and\ntreated as a legitimate man-of-war in the colonial ports\nof Great Britain.\nSir Alexander Cockburn was constrained to admit\nwant of due diligence as to the case of the Alabama,\nin three distinct classes of facts, each one of which\nsufficed to establish the responsibility of the British\nGovernment.\nIf Sir. Alexander had any good cause to accuse his\ncolleagues, as he did, of precipitancy and want of\nknowledge or practice of law, because they came to\nprovisional conclusions in the case of the Florida\nwithout waiting to hear Sir Roundell Palmer, surely\nthe British Government had reason to attach the\nsame censure to him in the case of the Alabama. rr\n1\n120\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nHow could he presume to condemn Great Britain in\nthis behalf, ignorantly, blindly, in the dark, and without assistance of the \" reasoning and learning \" of the\nCD \u25a0   CD\neminent Counsel in attendance on the Tribunal ?\n\" But even Sir Alexander Cockburn could no longer\nresist the force of conviction, nor help admitting the\ntruth of the allegation of the United States, their\nAgent and Counsel, imputing culpable negligence to\nhis Government. The United States had, not without cause, brought the British Government to the bar\nof public opinion and of the Tribunal of Arbitration;\nhimself now confessing it. their Agent and Counsel\nCD * CD\nhad not been engaged, as he had charged, in preferring \"false accusations, unworthy of them and of\ntheir Government.\" And if the proved and admitted truth of these accusations implies impeachment\nof the personal honor of any British Minister or Ministers, that is not the fault of the American Government, its Agent or Counsel, but of the British Government, whose violation of neutrality is at length\nconceded even by Sir Alexander Cockburn.\nIn the ultimate judgment of all the Arbitrators,\nthe condemnation of the Alabama and the Florida\ncarried with it the condemnation of their respective\ntenders, namely, the Tuscaloosa, the Clarence, the Ta-\ncony, and the Archer.\nCASE OF THE \"SHENANDOAH\" DECIDED.\nThere remained but three vessels \u2022 as to whose responsibility we had reason to have hopes, namely,\nthe Georgia, the Retribution, and the Shenandoah; ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n121\nand with confident expectation only as to the Shenandoah after she left Melbourne. Without pausing\nhere to consider particularly the Retribution and the\nGeorgia, suffice it to say that eventually they were\nrejected; but the Shenandoah, after special.explanations in writing submitted by. the Counsel of the two\nGovernments, was held responsible by vote of three\nof the Arbitrators, Count Sclopis, Mr. Staernpfli, and\nMr. Adams. As the Shenandoah, after increasing\nher armament at Melbourne, had made many captures\nat the very close of the war, when her cruise could\nnot be of any possible advantage to the Confederates,\nher exoneration by the' Tribunal would have been\njustly regarded by us as an act of great injustice to\nthe United States.\nTHE SPECIAL ARGUMENTS.\nIt remains next to speak of the successive Arguments of Counsel before the Tribunal, as well those\nheretofore indicated as others called for in the sequel.\nOn the 25th of July, as we have seen, the Tribunal voted to require from the Counsel of Great\nBritain a written or printed Argument touching certain points.\nOn the 29th, Lord Tenterden announced that he\nhad delivered the required Argument of the British\nCounsel to the Secretary of the Tribunal.\nThe copy thus delivered was in manuscript. As\nsubsequently printed, it consists of 43 folio pages.\nThe replies of the American Counsel, each of them\naddressing the Tribunal separately, were presented\n-^ 122\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\non the 5th, 6th, and 8th of August, consisting altogether of 47 pages of the same folio impression.\nIt would not be convenient, and it does not come\nwithin my plan, to discuss the Arguments .of Counsel\non either side, except where some particular point of\nsuch Argument calls for notice. Hence, as in the\ncase of the general Arguments of April and of June,\nso as to the special Arguments called for by the Tribunal, it will be sufficient to enumerate them, and to\ngive to them their proper place in the history of the\nArbitration.\nThe first Argument of Sir Roundell Palmer, however, calls for some observations.\nOf his. 43 pages, 31,\u2014say three quarters,\u2014are devoted nominally to the question of due diligence generally considered.\nNow, in the previous regular Arguments, each Government had fully discussed this question, and had,\nas if by common consent, concluded in express terms\n\u2022that it neither required nor admitted any further discussion. That conclusion was correct. Accordingly,\nmost of these 31 pages are occupied with matters remotely, if at all, connected with the question, What\nconstitutes due diligence ?\u2014such as [copying, word for\nword, sundry marginal notes] rules and principles\nof international law; express or implied engagements\nof Great Britain; effect of prohibitory municipal laws^\nthe three Rules of the Treaty; the maxims cited by\nthe United States from Sir Robert Phillimore <5n the\nquestion, Civitas ne deliquerit an cives; for what purpose Great Britain refers to her municipal laws; doc- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n123\ntrine of Tetens as to municipal laws in excess of antecedent international obligations; the arguments as\nto the prerogative powers belonging to the British\nCrown; the true doctrine as to the powers of the\nCrown under British law; the British Crown has\npower by common law to use the civil, military, and\nnaval forces of the Realm to stop acts of war within\nBritish territory; the preventive powers of British\nlaw explained; examination of the preventive powers of the American Government under the Acts of\nCongress for the preservation of neutrality:\u2014and so\nof diverse other questions discussed by Sir Roundell\nPalmer under the head of due diligence generally\nconsidered. Very generally, it is clear. Nay, 13 of\nthe 31 pages devoted to the question of \" due diligence generally considered\" are occupied with examination of the laws and political history of the\nUnited States, in continuance and iteration of the\ngroundless and irrelevant accusations of the American Government introduced into the British Case and\nCounter-Case.\nNow Sir Roundell Palmer is, omnium consensu, at\nthe head of the British Bar in learning, intelligence,\nand integrity; and we may be sure that arguments\naddressed by him to the Tribunal would be the best\nthat such a lawyer, so high in mental and moral qualities, or that, any living lawyer, be he who he may,\ncould devise or conceive. The British Arbitrator had\ngone \" clean daft\" in the hope deferred of hearing him.\nHe himself had been earnestly seeking to be heard\nby the Tribunal for more than a month; he had com- 124\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ntemplated being heard for many months. And the\nresult of all this meditation, and of all this earnest\ndesire to serve his country, was a series of arguments\nmostly immaterial to the issue, as the final judgment\nof the Tribunal plainly shows, and coming in after the\nmain question had been actually settled in the cases\nof the Alabama and the Florida. That is to say,\u2014\nand it is in this relation the point is introduced,\u2014\nthe claims of the United States rested on a basis\nwhich all the great forensic skill and ability of Sir\nCD tf\nRoundell Palmer could not move,\u2014which commended itself to the confidence of the neutral Arbitrators,\n\u2014and which even extorted the reluctant adhesion of\nthe prejudiced British Arbitrator.\nSubsequently, on requirement of the Arbitrators,\nwe discussed, in successive printed Arguments, the\nspecial question of the legal effect of the entry of\nthe Florida into Mobile; the question of the recruitment of men for the Shenandoah at Melbourne; and\nthe question of interest as an element of the indemnity due to the United States.\nQUESTION OF DAMAGES.\nMeanwhile, the Tribunal had voted definitively on\nthe question of the liability or non-liability of Great\nBritain for the acts of the cruisers named in the\n\" Case\" of the United States, in the terms which will\nappear in explaining their final judgment. They had\nalso voted on several of the incidental questions, such\nas the abstract question of due diligence, entry into\nConfederate ports, commission, and supply of coal, ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n125\nraised by successive requirements of the Tribunal.\nThey had thus arrived at the point of discussing\nmatters, which only affected the form and the amount\nof the judgment to be rendered against Great Britain.\nAnd here, on the 26th of August, the Tribunal\nvoted to deliberate with closed doors, in spite of the\nobjection of Sir Alexander Cockburn.\nThenceforth, and until the final Conference of the\n14th of September, the Tribunal sat with closed doors,\nthat is, without the assistance of the Agents and\nCounsel.\nDown to this time, the Agent, Counsel, Solicitor,\nand Secretaries of the United States had been assiduously occupied in preparing, copying, translating, and\nprinting Arguments and other documents for the use\nof the Tribunal. And even when the regular discussions were ended, we had still to attend to the\nlaborious task, of preparing schedules of the claims\nof the United States in response to argumentative\nestimates filed by the British Government.\nFINAL JUDGMENT OF THE TRIBUNAL.\nOn the 9th of September the Arbitrators definitively adopted the Act of Decision, which had been\nconsidered at the preceding Conference, and ordered\nit to be printed. They also resolved that the Decision should be signed at the next Conference, to be\nheld with open doors, and they then adjourned to the\n14th. 126\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DECISION.\nOn Saturday, the 14th of September, the Tribunal\nassembled at the hour of adjournment,\u2014half-past\ntwelve o'clock. The Hall of Conference was crowded\nat this hour with the Arbitrators and the gentlemen\nattached to the Arbitration, the ladies of their-respective families, the members of the Cantonal Government, representatives of the Press of Switzerland, the\nUnited States, and Great Britain, and gentlemen and\nladies among the most estimable of the private citizens of Geneva. The day was beautiful; the scene\nimposing and impressive. But the British Arbitrator,.\nSir Alexander Cockburn, remained unaccountably ab-\nsent, while curiosity grew into impatience, and impatience into apprehension, until long after the prescribed hour of meeting, when the British Arbitrator.\nfinally made his appearance.\nThe official action of the Conference commenced\nwith the accustomed formalities.\nThe President then presented the Act of Decision\nof the Tribunal, and directed the Secretary to read it\nin English, which was done: after which duplicate\noriginals of the Act were signed by Mr. Adams, Count\nFrederic Sclopis, Mr. Staernpfli, and Viscount ofItajub&;\nand a copy of the Decision, thus signed, was delivered\nto each of the Agents of the two Governments respectively.\nAnother original was subscril>ed in like manner, to\nbe placed, together with the archives of the Tribunal,\namong the archives of the Council of State of the Canton of Geneva. ALABAMA CLAIMS;\n127\nSir Alexander Cockburn, as one of the Arbitrators,\ndeclining to assent to the Decision, presented a statement of his \" Reasons,\" which, without reading, the\nTribunal ordered to be received and recorded.\nThereupon, in an appropriate address, Count Sclopis\ndeclared the labors of the Arbitrators to be finished,\nand the Tribunal dissolved.\nThe discourse of Count Sclopis was immediately\nfollowed by sahos of artillery, discharged from the\nneighboring site of La Treille by order of the Cantonal Government, with display of the flags of Geneva\nand of Switzerland between those of the United States\nand of Great Britain.\nIt is impossible that any one of the persons present\non that occasion should ever lose the impression of\nthe moral grandeur of the scene, where the actual\nrendition of arbitral judgment on the claims of the\nUnited States against Great Britain bore witness to\nCD\nthe generous magnanimity of two of the greatest nations of the world in resorting to peaceful reason as\nthe arbiter of grave national differences, in the place\nof indulging in baneful resentments or the vulgar\nO       O CD\nambition of war. -yhis emotion was visible on almost\nevery countenance, and was manifested by the exchange of amicable salutations appropriate to the\nseparation of so many persons, who, month after\nmonth, had been seated side by side as members of\nthe Tribunal, or as Agents and Counsel of the two\nGovernments; for even the adverse Agents and Counsel had contended with courteous weapons, and had\nnot, on either side, departed, intentionally or con- 128\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nsciously, from the respect due to themselves, to one\nanother, and to their respective Governments.\nCONDUCT OF THE BRITISH ARBITRATOR\nTo the universal expression of mutual courtesy and\nreciprocal good-will there was but one exception, and\nthat exception too conspicuous to pass without notice.\nThe instant that Count Sclopis closed, and before\nthe sound of his last words had died on the ear, Sir\nAlexander Cockburn snatched up his hat, and, without participating in the exchange of leave-takings\naround him, without a word or sign of courteous rec-\nognition for any of his colleagues, rushed to the door\nO v CD *\nand disappeared, in the manner of a criminal escaping\nfrom the dock, rather than of a judge separating, and\nthat forever, from his colleagues of the Bench.   It was\n' CD\none of those acts of discourtesy which shock so much\nwhen they occur that we feel relieved by the disap-\npearance of the perpetrator.\nSIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S REASONS FOB DISSENT.\nThe British Arbitrator, who, so frequently in the\ncourse of the Conferences, acted as a party agent\nrather than a judge, had been occupying himself in\nthe preparation of a long Argument on the side of\nGreat Britain, in which he throws off the mask, and\nprofessedly speaks as the representative of the British Government. He withheld this Argument from\nthe knowledge of the Tribunal at the proper time\nfor its presentation as the \"Reasons\" of an Arbitrator.\nAt the last moment,\u2014without its being read to the ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n129\nTribunal, or printed for the information of Agents\nand Counsel, as a resolution of the Tribunal, adopted\non his own motion, required,\u2014he presents this Argument as his \"Reasons . . . for dissenting from the\nDecision of the Tribunal of Arbitration.\" The title\nof the document is a false pretense, as we shall conclusively show in due. time: the act was a dishonorable imposition on the Tribunal, and on both Governments, Great Britain as much as the United\nStates.\nIn point of fact, the document filed by Sir Alexander was in large part of such a character that, if it\nhad been offered for filing at any proper time, and\nwith opportunity to persons concerned to become acquainted with its contents, it must [as declared by\nthe Secretary of State of the United States in his dispatch to the American Agent of October 22, 1872]\nhave been the plain duty of the American Agent\nto object to its reception, and of the Tribunal to refuse it, as calculated and designed to weaken the just\nauthority of the Arbitrators, as insulting to the United\nStates in the tenor of much of its contents, and as injurious to Great Britain by its tendency to raise up\nobstacles to the acceptance of the Award, and to produce alienation between the two Governments.\nThe document consisted, in part, of the opinions of\nSir Alexander Cockburn on the several vessels, copies\nof which he ought to have delivered in print to the\nAgent and Counsel of the United States, in conformity with his own resolution, but which he failed to\ndo, thus depriving the American Government of acL 130\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nvantages in this relation to which it was entitled,\nand which the British Government in fact enjoyed\nby reason of the more loyal conduct of the other Arbitrators.\nHe discusses these vessels with great prolixity, so\nas to fill 180 pages folio letter-press, while the corre-\n. spondent opinions of all the other Arbitrators united\noccupy only 66 pages, the difference being occasioned\npartly by the number of letters and other papers interjected into his opinions, and partly by the diffuse-\nness and looseness of his style and habit of thought,\nas compared with theirs.\nThe residue of Sir Alexander's document, consisting of 116 pages, is devoted partly to the discussion\nof the special questions, in all which he is inordinately prolix, and partly to a general outpouring of all\nthe bile which had been accumulating on his stom-\nCD\nach during the progress of the Arbitration.\nSIR ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S \"REASONS.\"\nLet me dispose once for all of these \"Reasons\" and\ntheir author, in order to arrive at subjects of more\nimportance and interest. The matter of the document, and the consideration it has received in England, require that it should be examined and judged\nfrom an American stand-point.\nApart from the unjudicial violence and extravagance of these \" Reasons,\" it is remarkable how inconsistent, how self- con tradictingj how destitute of\nlogical continuity of thought, how false as reasoning, as\nwell as irrelevant, is most of the matter. ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n131\nThe Reasons are on their face, and as the London\nPress could not fail to perceive and admit,\" an elaborate reply to the American Case\" [that is to say, an\nadvocate's plea], \"rather than a judicial verdict.\"\n\\Telegraph, September 25.]\nIt is, in truth, a mere nisi prius argument, not up\nto the level of an argument in banc; inappropriate\nto the character of a judge; and which might have\nbeen quite in place at Geneva as an \" Argument\" in\nthe cause, provided any British Counsel could have\nbeen found to write so acrimoniously and reason so\nbadly as Sir Alexander.\nTo establish these positions, it would suffice to cite\nsome of the criticisms of the London Press.\nThe Telegraph \u25a0 [September 26] argumentatively\ndemonstrates the palpable fallacy of the reasoning\nby which Sir Alexander endeavors to excuse the admitted violation of law and the want of due diligence of the British Government in the case of the\nFlorida, especially at Nassau.\nThe News [September 26] condemns and regrets\nthe declaration made by Sir Alexander in his \" Reasons \" twice, where he speaks of himself \" sitting on\nthe Tribunal as in some sense the representative of\nGreat Britain,\" and contrasts this with the sounder\nview of his duty expressed in Parliament by Lord\nCairns.\nCompare, now, this observation of the News with\ncertain pertinent remarks of the Telegraph [September 25]. Speaking of Mr. Adams, it says: \" He put\naside the temper of the advocate when he took his 132\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nseat on the Bench, and he performed the difficult duty\nwith the impartiality of a jurist and the delicate honor\nof a gentleman? And this well-merited commendation of Mr. Adams is prefatory to the exhibition of\nSir Alexander Cockburn retaining still \"the temper\nof an advocate when he took his seat on the Bench,\"\nand not performing his duties \"with the impartiality\nof a jurist and the delicate honor of a gentleman,\" but\nto the contrary; as shown by his deportment at Geneva, and authenticated under his own hand in these\n\" Reasons.\"\nThere is no escape from the dilemma: it was honorable to Mr. Adams to act as a \"judge\" at Geneva;\nand, of course, to act as a mere \" advocate\" was dishonorable to Sir Alexander Cockburn.\nAnd thus we may comprehend at a glance, what\nseems so remarkable to the Telegraph [September 26],\nthat when we pass from the printed opinions of the\nthree neutral Arbitrators, whose \"fairness\" nobody\ndisputes, and from those of the impartial jurist\"\nand honorable \" gentleman,\" Mr. Charles Francis Adams, to the \"Reasons\" of Sir Alexander Cockburn,\n\" We seem to go into another climate of opinion. . . .\nWe find different premises, a different bias, a different logic, and we might almost say different facts.\"\nSo it is, indeed; and the explanation is obvious.\nThe \"climate\" of Count Sclopis, Baron d'ltajuba, Mr.\nStaernpfli, and Mr. Adams, was that of fairness, judicial dignity, impartiality, gentlemanly honor, such as\nbelonged to their place as Arbitrators: the \"climate\"\nof Sir Alexander Cockburn was that of a self appoint- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n133\ned \"advocate,\" making no pretensions to \"fairness\" or\n\"impartiality,\" but, with the \"premises,\" \"bias,\" \"logic,\" and \" facts\" of such an advocate, drawing up a\npassionate, rhetorical plea, as the officious \" representative of Great Britain.\"\nAs such \" representative of Great Britain,\" if he be\nnot promptly disavowed by the British Government,\nit will be found that his \" Reasons \" lay down many\npositions which may somewhat embarrass present or\nsubsequent Ministers.\nThe News notices numerous contradictory opinions\nor conclusions which appear in the \"Reasons.\" In\none place Sir Alexander complains that any Rules are\nlaid down by the Treaty, and in another place expresses the conviction that it is well to settle such\nquestions by Treaty Rules. \" He complains . . . that\nthe Arbitrators have not been left free to apply the\nhitherto received principles of international law, and\nthat they have; that rules have been laid down,\nand that they have not; that definitions have been\nframed, and that they have not been framed.\" Here\nis most exquisite confusion of ideas. It is the very\nsame extraordinary and characteristic method of\nthinking and writing which Mr. Finlason had ex-\nhibited at length, and which Mr. Gathorne Hardy\npointed out in the case of the Queen against Norton: the \"inflammatory statements,\"\u2014the \"extra-judicial denunciation,\" the \" extra-judicial declamation,\"\nthe going \"from one side to another,\" and the saying \" it is \" and \" it is not\" upon every point of law.\nThe perfect similitude of these repulsive features of 134\nTHE TREATY. OF WASHINGTON.\nthe \" Charge\" and the \"Reasons\" can not be accidental: it must have its cause in idiosyncrasies of mental\nconstitution.\nThis vacillation or contradictoriness of opinion,\nwhich strikes the News so much, pervades the \" Reasons.\"\nThus Sir Alexander.admits want of due diligence\nin the matter of the Alabama, and yet stoutly denies\nthat the United States had any good cause of complaint against Great Britain. He insists that Ministers were to officiate within the limits of municipal\nlaw, and yet admits .that such is not the law of na-\ntions,!the force of which he also recognizes. He denies that the Ministers can lawfully exercise.any pre-\nrogative power in such matters, and yet justifies and\napproves the exercise of it [although too late] in the\ncase of the Shenandoah.\nThe News also calls attention to Sir Alexander's\n\" disaffection to the conditions under which he discharges his task, a task voluntarily accepted with\nfull knowledge of those conditions.\" \"He criticises\nadversely the Treaty of Washington: ... these criticisms seem to us to be extra vires. A derived authority ought surely to respect its source.. .. Other considerations than those laid down for him have certainly been present to the mind of Sir Alexander Cock-\nbu^n.', etc.\nThere is manifest justness in this criticism. What\nbusiness had Sir Alexander to indulge in continual\ncrimination of the Treaty of Washington, while acting as Arbitrator under it, and possessing no pow- ALABAMA  CLAIMS.\n135\ner or jurisdiction except such as the Treaty confers?\nTo do so was indecent in itself, and could have no effect other than to embarrass the British Government.\nWith his .habitual inconsistency of thought, to be\nsure, he advises submission to the judgment of the\nArbitrators, while exhausting himself in efforts to\nshake its moral strength and that of the Treaty. The\nTimes [September 28] plainly sees that the \"Reasons\" of Sir Alexander \"will be duly turned to account by Opposition critics.\" And perhaps that was\none of the objects Sir Alexander had in view, in thus\nusurping the function to judge the Treaty under the\ncover of acting as Arbitrator to judge the specific\nquestions submitted by.the Treaty.\nThe Times admits that the \" severity of the criticism passed by the Chief Justice on the United States\nand their Agents, and' even on his colleagues, may,\nfrom a diplomatic point of view, be some ground for\nregret;\". . . that \"perhaps he was too ready to consider himself the. representative of England;\" that\n\"perhaps he takes more than a judicial pleasure\" in\none argumentative suggestion; arid that \"he dwells,\nperhaps, with something too much of the delight of\nan advocate\" on some other point; and in each one\nof these admissions, qualified as they are, we perceive\nrecognition of the fact that, in his \"Reasons,\" Sir\nAlexander does not speak as an international Arbitrator, or manifest the qualities which ought to characterize a Chief Justice.\nThe News indicates other singular traits of \" irrelevance\" and confusion of mind in the.\" Reasons.\" 1\n136\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nExamination of the substance of the \" Reasons\"\nleads to still more unfavorable conclusions.\nWhile the Chief Justice exhausts himself in faultfinding with the Counsel of the United States, it is\nobservable that he seldom, if ever, grapples with their\narguments, but shoots off instead into epithets of mere\nvituperation. Indeed, if it were worth while, it would\nbe easy to show that he did not really read that which\nhe so intemperately criticises. And when he undertakes to deal with the text, it is only in the disingenuous manner of picking out here and there a detached\nparagraph or phrase for comment, regardless of the\ncontext or the general line of argument.\nNevertheless, when he has occasion to differ in\nopinion with the Counsel of the United States, such\nis the perverted state of passion and prejudice in\nwhich he thinks and writes, that he imputes to us intention to practice on t he \" supposed credulity and\nignorance \" of the Tribunal.\nWe were not amenable in anywise to the British\nArbitrator; but, if we had been barristers in his own\nCourt of whom such things were said by him, it would\nhave been an example of judicial indecency to parallel\nwhich it would be necessary to go back to the days\nof infamous judges like Jeffreys or Scroggs.\nLet Sir Alexander be judged by his own rule.\nGramming, as he did at Geneva, in the preparation of\nhis \" Reasons,\" he examined superficially and wrote\nprecipitately: in consequence of which he copied\nfrom the Arguments for the British Government palpable errors, which were exposed and corrected in\nJ ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n137\nthe Arguments for the United States. Thus it is that\nhe falls into the mistake of asserting a false construction of an Act of Congress, by having a mutilated\ntext before him, quoting a part of a sentence, which\nmay or may not justify his construction, and suppressing the context and the sequent words of the\nsame sentence, which clearly contradict his construction. Acting on his own theory of blind prejudice,\nwe should be compelled to assume that on this occasion he perpetrates a deed of deliberate bad faith,\nwith intention to practice on the \" supposed credulity\nand ignorance\" of the people of Great Britain.\n. Why did the British Arbitrator put together such\na mass of angry, irrelevant, confused, and contradictory declamation against the American Government,\n*and denunciation of its Agent and Counsel ? To vindicate the honor of British statesmen, Sir Alexander\ndeclares, in a speech at a banquet in London [November 4th], against unjust charges coming from the\nAmerican Government. But that should have been\ndone by speech or otherwise, as Si/r Alexander Cockburn professedly, and in England, and not under the\nfalse pretense of an Arbitrator at Geneva. And violent denunciation of our Case or Arguments constitutes no answer to our charges. And in such vituperation of the American Agent and Counsel, Sir Alexander not only throws off all pretense of judicial character, and assumes the tone of a mere advocate, but he\nacts the part of an advocate in temper and manner\nsuch as the proper Counsel of the British Government could not have descended to.    Indeed, the THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\n\" Reasons \" proceed from beginning to end on the hypothesis that the British Agent and Counsel had neglected their duty; that neither the Case, Counter-Case,\nnor Argument of the British Government, by whomsoever prepared, nor the several supplementary Arguments filed by Sir Roundell Palmer in his own name,\ncontained a proper exhibition of the defenses of the\nBritish Government; and more especially that Agent\nand Counsel alike had all been false to their country's\nhonor in not vindicating it against the charges of the\nAmericans. In view of this dereliction of duty, Sir\nAlexander volunteers to supply, more suo, the place\nof Counsel, and to respond to the American Agent\nand Counsel. ,\nAgainst what charges? The existence of an unfriendly state of mind toward the American Govern-1\nment in Parliament, or in some of the British Colonies at the period in question? Sir Alexander admits the fact in stronger terms than we had charged\nit.\u2014Failure to exercise due diligence in arresting the\nCD O\nequipment of Confederate cruisers, to depredate on\nour commerce? Sir Alexander admits and proves it,\nunder three heads, as to the Alabama, and only escapes the same admission as to the Florida by technicalities as unsatisfactory to impartial minds in England as in America.\u2014As the London Telegraph says,\nin another relation, Sir Alexander, whilst indignantly\nprotesting against our accusation of British officers,\nadmits their failure to do their duty, which is the\nfoundation of the accusation.. But for that marvelous confusion of ideas which distinguishes Sir Alex- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n139\nander, even he must have seen that, in confessing and\nproving the guilt of his Government, he estops himself from denying the justice of the accusation preferred by the United States.\nBut the point of honor was considered when the\nTreaty was signed. How strangely Sir Alexander\nforgets the attitude in which this objection stands in\nLord Russell's correspondence with Mr. Adams. If\nthere was any question of honor in the controversy,\nthat it was which forbade a treaty of arbitration, as\nLord Russell constantly maintained. But three successive Foreign Ministries, represented by Lord Stan^\nley, Lord Clarendon, and Lord Granville, had rightly\ndecided that the question at issue'did not involve the\nhonor of the British Government. Sir Alexander\nwastes his words over a dead issue; utterly buried out\nof sight by the stipulations of the Treaty of Washington.\nCD\nMr. John Lemoinne expresses the judgment of Europe, and anticipates that of history, in condemning\nSir Alexander's \"vehemence of polemic and bitterness of discussion, so extraordinary in an official document.\"\nStrangely enough, the Saturday Review, which pretends to see \" scurrility\" in the American Case and\n\u2022Argument, where it does not exist, is blind to it in\nthe \" Reasons,\" where it is a flagrant fact.\nMeanwhile, there is nothing accusatory of Great\nBritain in the American Case,\u2014there is nothing of\nearnest inculpation of the British Government in the\nAmerican Argument,\u2014which is not greatly exceeded 140\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nby extra-judicial accusation and inculpation of the\nUnited States in the \" Reasons\" of Sir Alexander.\nAnd it is amusing to read the imputations of \" confusion,\" \" vague and declamatory,\" \" ignorance of law\nand history,\" which he applies to the American Counsel, in view of what his own countrymen say of his\nown methods of argumentation. Indeed, it would\nseem that the hard words of Mr. Finlason and others\nconcerning him had made such effectual lodgment in\nhis brain that, whenever he writes, they rush forth\nhap-hazard to be applied by him without reason or\ndiscrimination to any occasional object of argument\nor controversy.\n!\u00a3, like Mr. Charles Francis Adams, Sir Alexander\nhad simply prepared brief and temperate opinions on\nall the questions, whether favorable or not to the\nUnited States, both Governments would have been\nleft in an amicable mood. As it is, in professedly\nthrowing off the character of a judge,\u2014which alone\nbelonged to him of right,\u2014of certain specific charges\nof the United States against Great Britain, submitted\nto him by the Treaty of \"W ashington,\u2014and in undertaking to become the mere accuser of the United\nStates,\u2014he does but insult the American Government, while subjecting his own Government to much\npresent inconvenience and great future embarrassment*\nThere is one particular feature of the \"Reasons\"\ntoo remarkable to be overlooked.\nIn reading these \"Reasons\" carefully, one can not\nfail to be struck by the frequent manifestation of the ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n141\ndisposition of Sir Alexander Cockburn to stop and\nturn aside in order to criticise Mr. Staernpfli.\nMr. Staernpfli, in conformity with the vote of the\nTribunal, printed his provisional opinions, and delivered th6m to the other Arbitrators from time to time,\nand to the respective Agents and Counsel.\nSir Alexander Cockburn disingenuously suppressed\nhis provisional opinions until the last moment, and\nthen filed a single copy only of the mass of matter,\ngeneral and special, entitled \"Reasons,\" which appears\nin print for the first time in the London Gazette.\nNow, in the provisional opinions of Mr. Staernpfli,\nit is quite possible there may have been some error\nof statement. Sir Alexander takes pains to affirm it.\nBut, if there be any such, it is quite immaterial, and\ndoes not affect any important conclusion either of fact\nor of law.\nSir Alexander also committed errors of this class in\nthe provisional opinions which he read. Some of\nthem were noted at the time, and are still remembered. -These errors may have been corrected in the\nprint which we now have. Indeed, the manuscript\nshows numerous corrections. Nevertheless, but for\nthe suppression of his provisional opinions, his colleagues might have interlarded their provisional or\nrevised opinions with similar captious criticisms of\nhim. It is presumable that they did not think it becoming or fair to do this; and it was to the last degree unfair in Sir Alexander to do it, in a document\nfoisted into the record, as it was, at the instant of adjournment, and immediately carried off without being 142\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nactually filed with the Secretary or otherwise placed\nin the archives of the Tribunal.\nNow, in the early pages of his \" Reasons,\" he imputes to Mr. Staernpfli the having said \"that there is\nno such thing as international law, and that consequently we [the Arbitrators] are to proceed independently of any such law,\" and \" according to some\nintuitive perception of right and wrong or speculative\nnotions, etc.\"\nThe imputation is calumnious. No such statement\nappears in any of the printed opinions of Mr. Staernpfli;\nno such declaration was ever made by him orally at.\nany of the Conferences. The declaration of Sir Alexander in this respect is but a sample of the rashness and inaccuracy of representation which pervade\nthe \" Reasons.\"\nWhat Mr. Staernpfli says on the general subject of\n\" international law,\" in so far as regards the matters\nbefore the Tribunal, is as follows:\n\"Principes geh6raux de droit.\n\"Dans ses considerants juridiques, le Tribunal doit se guider\npar les principes suivants:\u2014\n\" 1. En premier lieu, par les trois Regies posees dans 1'Article\nVI. du Trait6, lequel porte que,\u2014et cetera.\n\" D'apres le Trait6 ces trois Regies prevalent sur les principes\nque l'on pourrait deduire du droit des gens historique et de la\nscience.\n\" 2. Le droit des gens historique, oubien la pratique du droit\ndes gens, ainsi que la science et les autorites scientifiques,\npeuvent \u00a7tre considered comme droit subsidiaire, en tant que\nles principes a appliquer sont gen6ralement reconnus et ne sont\npoint sujets k controverse, ni en desaccord avec les trois Regies ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n143\ncidessus. Si l'une ou l'autre de ces conditions vient a manquer,\nc'est au Tribunal d'y suppleer en interpretant et appliquant les\ntrois Regies de son mieux et en toute conscience.\"\nAt the time when Sir Alexander sent to press his\nmisrepresentation of the opinions of Mr. Staernpfli, he\nhad in his hands the authentic statement thereof\nas printed at Geneva. There is no excuse, therefore,\nfor this malicious and dishonorable endeavor of the\nBritish Arbitrator to prejudice the character of the\nSwiss Arbitrator in Great Britain.\nNevertheless, Mr. Staernpfli, according to Sir Alexander, having cut adrift from all positive law, adopts\ninstead \" speculative notions,\" or \" some intuitive perception of right and wrong;\" and such ideas Sir Alexander repudiates: or, as the London Telegraph has\nit, \"the-Chief Justice, armed with sarcasm as well as\nlogic, runs full tilt against that doctrine:\" to wit, the\nCD      t CD '\ndoctrine, still in the words of the Telegraph, \" that the\nduties which nations owe to each other must be determined by the light of intuitive principles of justice.\" The Telegraph goes on, with truth and reason,\nto say that, after all, Mr. Staernpfli is right, if he insists\nthat \" the rules of fair dealing, which we term international law, are not law in the same sense as the positive edicts of the common law; for the essence of\nsuch edicts is that they come from a lawgiver in the\nform of a parliament or a sovereign: the rules of international justice are simply the code which experience and the judgment of able men have shown to be\nfair or expedient, but every civilized country feels\nthem to be not less binding on that account.\"   With- 144\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nout pausing to consider whether these observations\nare perfectly accurate or not as a definition of the law\nof nations, we may assume that they are substantially\nso, and suffice at any rate to show clearly the uncan-\ndid spirit of Sir Alexander's criticism of the imputed\nlanguage of Mr. Staernpfli,\u2014a criticism which calls to\nmind a similar unjust and vicious reproach cast by\nJunius on Lord Mansfield.\nThe actual statement of Mr. Staernpfli, as we have\nseen,, was unexceptionably accurate and precise, in so\nfar as regarded the matters before the Tribunal.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Staernpfli may have said orally, what\nhe says here in print, that in many supposable cases\nof deficient explicitness either of the conventional\nrules or of the historic law of nations, \" c'est au Tribunal d'y suppleer en interpretant et appliquant les\ntrois regies de son mieux et en toute conscience?\nCD\nThat is what the Viscount of Itajuba says in one\nof his opinions, namely, that a certain doctrine, asserted by the British Government,\" froisse la conscience.\"\nIt is what Count Sclopis intends, when he says,\" Les\nnations ont entre elles un droit commun, ou, si on aime\nmieux, un lien commun, forme par VeqwUe et sanction ne par le respect des interets reciproques;\" and\nthat such is the spirit of the Treaty of Washington,\n\" qui ne fait que donner la preference aux regies de\nl'equite generale sur les dispositions d'une legislation\nparticuliere quelle qu'elle puisse etre.\" That is \" the\nuniversal immutable justice,\" which in all systems of\nlaw, international or national, distinguishes right from\nwrong, and to which the United States appealed in ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n145\naddressing the Tribunal of Arbitration.    And it is\nCD\nthe negation of all these great principles of \"justice,\"\n\" equity,\" or \" conscience,\" which pervades the \" Reasons\" of Sir Alexander Cockburn: in reflecting on\nwhich, the mind irresistibly reverts to that same line\nof reasoning which astonished the world in his parliamentary advocacy of David Pacifico.\nAnd now, who is injured by Sir Alexander's acrimonious arraignment of the United States in the last\nhour of the Arbitration? It does not successfully\nmaintain the honor of the British Ministers; for it\nrecognizes their failure to exercise due diligence,\nwhether tried by the Treaty Rules, by the law of nations, or by the Act of Parliament. Does it influence\nthe action of the Tribunal? No: that was consummated already. Does it injure the American Government, its Agent and Counsel ? No: so far as regards\nus, it does but prove that the American Agent and\nCounsel have done their duty regardless of the vindictive ill-will of the British Arbitrator, and that the\nUnited States have been successful to such a degree\nas to throw the Chief Justice of England into ecstasies\n* CD\nof spiteful rage, in which he strikes out wildly against\nfriend and foe alike, but chiefly against his own Government, in his desultory criticism as well of the\nTreaty of Washington as of the judgment of the Tribunal of Arbitration.\nFor the British Government, we know, has no disposition to repudiate the Treaty, and it accepts the\nAward in good faith, and desires that it should be accepted by the people of Great Britain.   It can not be\nK 146\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nagreeable to the British Government to have all the\nold debate reopened by the Chief Justice,\u2014to have\nthe Treaty, its Rules, the Arbitration, and the Award,\nmade by him the subject of profuse denunciation,\u2014to\nhave an arsenal of weapons, good, bad, or indifferent,\ncollected by him for the use of the Opposition in Parliament.\nNor can it be agreeable to see the Arbitrator they\nhad appointed demean himself so fantastically, and,\nas the English Press is constrained to admit, in a\nmanner so painfully in contrast with the dignity and\njudicial impartiality of the American Arbitrator.\nThe Chancellor of the Exchequer [Mr. Lowe] gave\nutterance to these sentiments.of grief and regret in a\nspeech at Glasgow on the 26th of September, as follows:\n\" I conceive our duty to be to obey the Award, and to pay\nwhatever is assessed against us without cavil or comment of\nany kind. [Cheers.] I am happy to say that such is the opinion of my learned friend, the Lord Chief Justice. But I must\nsay, with the greatest submission to my learned friend, that I\nwish his practice had accorded a little more accurately with\nhis theory. He has advised us to submit, as I advise you to\nsubmit, to the Award, and not only to pay the money, but to\nforego for once the national habit of grumbling\u2014[laughter]\u2014\nand to consider that we are bound in honor to do what we are\ntold, and that, having once put the thing out of our power in\nthe honorable and the high-minded way in which the nation\nhas done, the only way in which we should treat it is simply\nto obey the Award, and to abstain from any comment whatever\nas to what the Arbitrators have done. [Cheers.] But,-if my\nlearned friend the Lord Chief Justice thought so, I can only\nvery much regret that he did not take the course of simply\nsigning the Award with the other Arbitrators, it being perfectly ALABAMA CLAIMS.\nwell known that he differed from them in certain respects, which\nwould appear by the transactions of the Award. I think it is a\npity when the thing is decided, when we are bound to act upon\nit, and when we are not really justified, in any feeling of honor\nor of good faith, in making any reclamation or quarrel at a\nwith what has been done, that he should have thought it his\n\u25a0duty to stir up and to renew all the strong arguments and contests upon which these Arbitrators have decided. [Cheers.]\nI think if it was his opinion that we ought to acquiesce quietly\nand without murmur in the Award, he had better not have published his argument, and, if he thought it right to publish his\nargument, he had better have retrenched his advice itself as to\nthe arbitration.\"\nMr. Lowe can not help seeing that the \"Reasons\"\nare not an opinion, but an \" argument,\" and an \" argument\" adverse to the conclusions of the writer.\nThus, it would appear, such is the eccentric mental\nconstitution of the Chief Justice, that while he is incapable of going through any process of reasoning\nwithout inconsistencies and self-contradictions at every step, so he can not perform an act, or recommend\nits performance, without at the same time setting\nforth ample reasons to forbid its performance.\nIn the recent debate in Parliament, to be sure, on\nthe Queen's speech, some of the members of both\nHouses, especially of those in Opposition, speak in\nterms of laudation of the \" Reasons\" of the Chief Justice. Lord Cairns, on this occasion, seems to have forgotten what he had said, on a previous occasion, of the\njudicial impartiality to be expected of an arbitrator.\nAnd Mr. Vernon Harcourt, in defending the Chief\nJustice against what the Chancellor of the Exchequer\nhad said of him at Glasgow, unconsciously falls into 148\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthe error of characterizing him as \" the representative\nof the Crown, sent forth to discharge his duty to his\nSovereign and maintain the honor of his country:\"\nwhich affords to Mr. Lowe opportunity of responding\ntriumphantly as follows:\n\"I have not spoken of the Lord Chief Justice in the language in which the honorable and learned gentleman has\nspoken of him, and which filled me with unbounded astonishment. The Lord Chief Justice was sent to Geneva as an Arbitrator to act impartially, and not to allow himself to be\nbiased by the fact of his being an Englishman, but to give his\njudgment on what he thought to be the merits of the case.\nThat is my belief with regard to the Lord Chief Justice, with\nregard to whom I am arraigned by the honorable and learned\ngentleman as having treated him disrespectfully. But how\ndoes the honorable and learned gentleman himself speak of the\nLord Chief Justice ? He says that learned Judge was a plenipotentiary,\u2014that is to say, that he went to Geneva to do the\nwork of England, and not to decide between two parties impartially, but to be biased in his course, and to go all lengths\nfor England. The conduct of the Lord Chief Justice negatives\nsuch a statement, because in some respects the learned lord\nwent against us. Then the honorable and learned gentleman\nsaid that the Lord Chief Justice was sent to Geneva to defend\nthe honor of this country; but the fact is that he was sent to arbitrate, and 8ir Roundell Palmer and others were sent to defend\nthe honor of the country. It would be a libel on the Lord Chief\nJustice to insinuate that he would undertake the office of going\nto Geneva nominally in the character of Arbitrator, but really\nto act as an advocate and plenipotentiary for this country.V\nIt is difficult to judge how much of what Mr. Lowe\nsaid on this occasion was intended as sincere defense\nof the Chief Justice, and how much was mere sarcasm.\nBut this uncertainty is due to the ambiguous and\nequivocal conduct of the Chief Justice himself, and ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n149\nto his own declaration that, while engaged in writing an extra-judicial pamphlet, under the false pretense of its being the act of an Arbitrator, he was\nreally speaking as the Representative of Great Britain. That was the mistake of the Chief Justice. It\nwas competent for him, after running away from the\nTribunal as he did, to publish in England the contents of the first part of the \"Reasons\" as a personal\nact. It was dishonorable in him to smuggle it into,\nthe archives of the Tribunal, and to publish it in the\nLondon Gazette as the official act of an Arbitrator.\nI\nIn view of all these incidents, and of the extraordinary contrast between the conduct of Mr. Adams and\nSir Alexander Cockburn, as admitted by Englishmen\nthemselves, it is easy to comprehend that, while the\nformer has been honored with the express official\ncommendation of both Governments, the latter, by\nwantonly insulting his fellow-Arbitrators and the\nUnited States, has, while receiving partisan praise in\nParliament, rendered it difficult, if not impossible, for\nhim to receive the hearty approval even of his own\nGovernment.\nOPINIONS OF THE OTHER ARBITRATORS.\nThe other Arbitrators also placed on record their\nseparate opinions as finally corrected, all which deserve notice. Each of these opinions consists of an\naffirmative exposition of the views of the Arbitrator\nwho speaks. Count Sclopis, Mr. Staernpfli, the Vicomte\nd'ltajuba, and Mr. Adams, each of them states his conclusions founded on the documents and arguments be-\n^ 150\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nfore the Tribunal. Neither of them seems to have\nimagined that the cause of truth or of justice would\nhave been promoted by going outside of the docu\nm'ents and arguments submitted, in order to criticise\nor cavil at the opinions of the British Arbitrator.\nWe begin with Mr. Adams. His opinions are of\nsome length; and, although containing correct statements of local law where such statements were material, yet deserve to be regarded in the better light of\ndiplomacy and of international jurisprudence. He\ndoes not descend from the Bench into the arena of the\nBar. If he had seen fit to do this, he might have discovered quite as much inducement to* acrimony and\nacerbity of discussion in the wanton accusations of\nthe entire political life of the United States, which\nthe British Case, Counter-Case, and Argument contain, as Sir Alexander did in any thing which the\nCases and Argument of the United States contained.\nBut he yielded to no such temptation. \"He put\naside the temper of the advocate,\" as the Telegraph\ntruly says, to speak \" with the impartiality of a jurist\nand the delicate honor of a gentleman.\" Accordingly,\nhis opinions are without blemish either in temper or\nin language.    He finds want of due diligence in the\nCD CD O\nmatter of the Alabama: and so did the British Arbitrator. He finds extraordinary disregard of law in\nthe matter of the Florida: and so did the 'British\nArbitrator. He finds a series of acts of scandalous\nwrong perpetrated by officers of the British Government in both these cases: and so did the British Arbitrator.    He can not, as the British Arbitrator does, ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n151\nfind justification for the acts of negligence of British\nColonial authorities in the matter of the Shenandoah\nor that of the Retribution. And, as might have been\nanticipated, his conception of the duties of a State\nsuppose a higher standard of national morality than\nthat recognized by the British Arbitrator.\nMr. Staampfli's opinions are also of considerable\nlength, but differ from those of Mr. Adams, especially\nin the form, which is that customary among the jurists\nof the Continent. He also, while confining himself to\nthe most rigorous deductions of international law, in\ndiscussing the acts of the inculpated Confederate cruisers, yet writes like a statesman, habituated to breathe\nthe air of that \" climate\" of \" the impartiality of a\njurist and the delicate honor of a gentleman\" which\nwas not the \" climate\" of the British Arbitrator.\nThe opinions of the Vicomte d'ltajuba are very\nbrief, but in the same form of analysis as the opinions\nof Mr.'Staempfli. It is to be noted, however, that, beyond stating his reasoning and conclusion as to each\nof the inculpated cruisers, he speaks of only one of the\nspecial questions argued, namely, that of the effect to\nbe given in British ports to the Confederate cruisers\nexhibiting commissions. As to this point he concludes as follows:\n\" La commission dont un tel navire est pourvu, ne suffit pas\npour le couvrir vis-a-vis du neutre dont-il a viole la neutralite.\nEt comment le belligeVant se plaindrait-il de l'application de\nce principe ? En saisissant ou detenant le navire, le neutre ne\nfait qu'empScher le belligerant de tirer profit de la fraude com-\nmise sur son territoire par ce m&ne belligerant; tandis que,\nen ne procedant point contre le navire coupable, le neutre 152\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ns'expose justement a ce que l'autre bellig\u00a3rant suspecte sa\nbonne foV\nIn these observations, we see that the Vicomte\nd'ltajuba appeals to the same \" intuitive-perceptions\nof right\" which are so unpalatable to the British Arbitrator.\nThe Vicomte d'ltajuba does not give us any opinion on the.subject of \" due diligence generally considered :\" which tends to prove that his call for argument\non that point was not induced by any need on his\npart for elucidation of Counsel.\nThe opinions of Count Sclopis,\u2014not only those in\nwhich he judges the particular cases, but especially\nthose in which he discusses the questions of public\nlaw, as to which mere opinion was drawn from the Arbitrators, virtually at the instance of Great Britain,\u2014\nare instructive and interesting disquisitions, of permanent value as the views of an erudite legist and a\nCD\npracticed statesman. The paper on due diligence is\nremarkable for its profound and comprehensive view\nof that subject in its higher relation to the acts of\nsovereign States. In this paper, he thoroughly exposes\nthe fallacy of the argument of Sir Roundell Palmer,\nwhich would lower the generality and the greatness\nof the Treaty Rules to the level of the municipal law\nof Great Britain.\nAnd now, having reviewed the stipulations of the\nTreaty in this respect, the debates attending it both\nbefore and after its conclusion, the proceedings of the\nTribunal of Arbitration, and the separate opinions of\nthe Arbitrators, we come to the consideration of what\nJ ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n153\nthey actually decided, the immediate effect of the Decision, and the general relation thereof to Great Britain, to the United States, and to the other Governments of Europe and America.\nREVIEW OF THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL ON NATIONAL\nLOSSES.\nTo begin, let us see what was the true thought of\nthe Tribunal regarding the class of claims, as to which\nthe British Government displayed so much superfluous emotion subsequently to the publication of the\nAmerican Case, and which the Tribunal passed upon,\nin effect, without previous decision whether they were\nor were not embraced in the Treaty.\nI have already called attention to the fact that no\nconsideration of direct or indirect, immediate or conse-\nquentialf appears in that opinion of the Tribunal.\nThe Arbitrators express a conclusion, not the reasons\nof the conclusion. We might, it is true, easily infer\nthose reasons from the language in which the conclu-\nsion is expressed. That language excludes all such\ntrivial questions as whether \" direct\" or \" indirect,\"\nand invokes us to seek for the unexpressed reasons in\nsome higher order of ideas. Meanwhile we have, at\nlength, in the final \" Decision,\" means of ascertaining\nthe whole thought of the Tribunal.\nThe Arbitrators had to pass on a claim of indemnity for the costs of pursuit of Confederate cruisers by\nthe Government:\u2014a claim admitted to be within the\njurisdiction of the Tribunal, and which the Tribunal\nrejects on the ground that such costs \" are not, in the 154\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\njudgment of the Tribunal, properly distinguishable\nfrom the general expenses of the war carried on by\nthe United States.\"\nHere, the major premise is assumed as already determined or admitted, namely, that \" the general expenses of the war \" are not to be made the subject of\naward. Why not? Because such expenses are in\nthe nature of indirect losses ? No such notion is intimated.    Because the claim, as being for indirect\n* CD\nlosses, is not within the purview of the Treaty ? That\nis not said or implied. Because such a claim is beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal? No: for the\nTribunal takes jurisdiction and judges in fact. The\nquestion then remains,\u2014why is a claim for losses\npertaining to the general expenses of the war to be\nrejected ?\nThere can be no mistake as to the true answer. It\nis to be found in the preliminary opinion expressed\nby the Arbitrators.\nThe Tribunal, in that opinion, says that the controverted [the so-called indirect] claims \" do not constitute, upon the principles of international law applicable to such cases, good foundation for an award of\ncompensation or computation of damages between nations.\" Why does not the injury done to a nation by\nthe destruction of its commerce, and by the augmentation of the duration and^xpenses of war, constitute \" a\ngood foundation for an award of compensation or computation of damages between nations ?\" The answer\nis that such subjects of reclamation are \" not properly\ndistinguishable from'the general expenses of war.\" ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n155\nLet us analyze these two separate but related\nopinions, and thus make clear the intention of the\nTribunal.   It is this:\nThe.injuries done to a Belligerent by the failure of\na Neutral to exercise due diligence for the prevention\nof belligerent equipments in its ports, or the issue of\nhostile expeditions therefrom, in so far as they are injuries done to the Belligerent in its political capacity\nas a nation, and resolving themselves into an element\nof the national charges of war sustained by the Belligerent in its political capacity as a nation, do not,\n\" upon the principles of international law applicable\nto such cases\" [excluding, that is, the three Rules],\nconstitute \" good foundation for an award of compensation or computation of damages between nations.\"\nSuch, in my opinion, is the thought of the Arbitrators, partially expressed in one place as to certain\nclaims of which they did not take jurisdiction, and\npartially in another place as to others of which they\ndid take jurisdiction,\u2014the two partial statements being complementary one of the other, and forming together a perfectly intelligible and complete judgment\nas to the whole matter.\nThe direct effect of the judgment as between the\nUnited States and Great Britain, is to prevent either\nGovernment, when a Belligerent, from claiming of the\n/ CD O\nother, when a Neutral, \" an award of compensation or\ncomputation of damages\" for any losses or additional\ncharges or \" general expenses of war,\" which such Belligerent, in its political capacity as a nation, may suffer by reason of the want of due diligence for the 156\n*\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nprevention of violation of neutrality in the ports of\nsuch Neutral. That is to say, the parties to the\nTreaty of Washington are estopped from claiming\ncompensation, one of the other, on account of the national injuries occasioned by any such breaches of\nneutrality, not because they are indirect losses,\u2014for\nthey are not,\u2014but because they are national losses,\nlosses of the State as such. And each of us may, in\ncontroversies on the same point with other nations,\nallege the moral authority of the Tribunal of Geneva.\nBut, while national losses incurred by the Bellig*-\nerent as a State in consequence of such breaches of\nneutrality are not to be made the subject of \" compensation or computation of damages,\" all private or\nindividual losses may be, under the qualifications and\nlimitations as to character and amount found by the\nTribunal, and which will be explained in treating of\nthat part of the Decision.\nThese conclusions are the inevitable result of careful comparison of the several claims with the several\ndecisions. True it is, the national claims of indemnity for the cost of the pursuit of the Confederate\ncruisers happened to come before the Tribunal associated with strictly private claims, and the strictly\nprimate claims on account of payment of extra war\npremiums associated with national claims; but these\nare perfectly immaterial incidents, which do not in\nany way affect appreciation of the opinions of the\nTribunal.\nAnother subject of reflection suggests itself, in\ncomparing the respective decisions on national and ALABAMA CLAIMS.\non private losses, produced by the failure of a Neutral to maintain neutrality.\nWe asserted the responsibility of Great Britain\nfor the acts of such of the Confederate cruisers as\ncame within either of the three Rules, just as if those\ncruisers had been fitted out or supplied by the British Government, to the extent at least of the prizes\nof private property which those cruisers made. That\nwas the theory of imputed responsibility. Any cruiser enabled to make prizes by the fault of the British Government was to be regarded as pro tanto a\nBritish cruiser, and Great Britain, in the words of\nthe British Counter-Case, \"treated [in that respect]\nas a virtual participant in the war.\" The Tribunal\nseems to have so held; that is, in regard to the losses\nof individual citizens of the United States.\nMoreover, it was argued on both sides, as by common consent, that the question between the two\nGovernments was one of war, commuted for indemnity.\n\" Her [Great Britain's] acts of actual or constructive complicity with the Confederates,\" says the American Argument,\n\"gave to the United States the same right of war against her,\nas in similar circumstances she asserted against the Netherlands.\n\" We, the United States, holding those rights of war, have\nrelinquished them to accept instead the Arbitration of this\nTribunal. And the Arbitration substitutes correlative legal\ndamages in the place of the right of war.\"\nThis position is clearly stated in the British Counter-Case as follows:\n\"Her Majesty's Government readily admits the general 158\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\n\" principle that, where an injury has been done by one nation\n\" to another, a claim for some appropriate redress arises, and\n\" that it is on all accounts desirable that this right should be\n1 satisfied by amicable reparation instead of being enforced by\n\" war. All civil society reposes on this principle, or on a prin-\n\" ciple analogous to this; the society of nations, as well as that\n| which unites the individual members of each particular com-\n\" monwealth.\"\nNow the capture of private property on the seas,\nit can not be denied, is one of the methods of public\nwar. Whether such capture be made by letters of\nmarque, or by regular men-of-war, is immaterial; in\neither form it increases the resources of one Belligerent and it weakens those of the other; and if the\nNeutral fits out [or, in violation of neutral duty, suffers to be fitted out in its ports, which is the same\nthing] cruisers in aid of one of the Belligerents, such\nNeutral becomes a virtual participant in the war, not\nonly prolonging it and augmenting its expenses, but\nperhaps producing decisive effects adverse to the\nother Belligerent.    These are the national losses, or,\nCD J I\nas the British Government insists, the indirect losses,\ninflicted by neglect or omission to discharge the obligations of neutrality.\nIn deciding that such losses,\u2014that, in general,\nthe national charges of war,\u2014can not by the law of\nnations be regarded as \"good foundation for an\naward of compensation or computation of damages\nbetween nations,\" the Tribunal in effect relegated\nthat question to the unexplored field of the discretion of sovereign States.\nClaims of indemnity for the national losses grow- \u00ab\u00ab\u25a0\nALABAMA CLAIMS.\ning out of a state of war being thus disposed of, we\narrive at the great class of private losses, which chiefly occupied the time of the Tribunal.\nDECISION AS TO PRIVATE LOSSES.\nThe Arbitrators, assuming that, pursuant to the\ncommand of the Treaty, they are to be governed by\nthe three Rules, and the principles of international\nlaw not incompatible therewith, proceed to lay down\nthe following prefatory positions, namely:\n1. \"The 'due diligence' referred to in the first and third of\nthe said Rules, ought to be exercised by neutral Governments\nin exact proportion to the risks to which either of the Belligerents may be exposed from a failure to fulfill the obligations of\nneutrality on their part.\n2.\" The circumstances, out of which the facts constituting the\nsubject-matter of the present controversy arose, were of a nature to call for the exercise on the part of Her Britannic Majesty's Government of all possible solicitude for the observance\nof the rights and the duties involved in the proclamation of\nneutrality issued by Her Majesty on the 13th dayof May, 1861.\n3. \" The effects of a violation of neutrality committed by\nmeans of the construction, equipment, and armament of a vessel are not done away with by any commission which the Government of the belligerent Power benefited by the violation of\nneutrality may afterward have granted to that vessel; and the\nultimate step, by which the offense is completed, can not be\nadmissible as a ground for the absolution of the offender; nor\ncan the consummation of his fraud become the means of establishing his innocence.\n4. \" The privilege, of ex-territoriality accorded to vessels of\nwar has been admitted into the laws of nations, not as an absolute right, but solely as a proceeding founded on the principle of courtesy and mutual deference between different nations, and therefore can never be appealed to for the protection of acts done in violation of neutrality. 160\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\n5. \" The absence of a previous notice can not be regarded as\na failure in any consideration required by the law of nations,\nin those cases in which a vessel carries with it its own condemnation.\n6. \"In order to impart to any supplies of coal a character\ninconsistent with the second Rule, prohibiting the use of neutral ports or waters, as a base of naval operations for the Belligerent, it is necessary that the said supplies should be connected with special circumstances of time, of persons, or of\nplace, which may combine to give them such character.\"\nKeeping in view these rules of construction, the\nTribunal proceeds to judge the British Government\nin regard to each of the Confederate cruisers before\nthem.\nAs to the Alabama, originally \"No. 290,\" constructed in the port of Liverpool and armed near Terceira,\nthrough the agency of the Agrippina and JBahama,\ndispatched from Great Britain to that end, the Tribunal decides that the British Government failed to\nuse due diligence in the performance of its \"neutral\nobligations:\nCD\n1. Because \" it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and\nofficial representations made by the diplomatic agents of the\nUnited States during the construction of the said' No. 290,' to\ntake in due time any effective measures of prevention, and that\nthose orders which it did give at last, for the detention of the\nvessel, were issued so late that their execution was not practicable ;\" 2. Because,\" after the escape of that vessel, the measures taken for its pursuit and arrest were so imperfect as to\nlead to no result, and therefore can not be considered sufficient\nto release Great Britain from the responsibility already incurred ;\" 8. Because,\" in despite of the violations of the neutrality of Great Britain committed by the' 290,' this same vessel, later known as the Confederate cruiser Alabama, was on\nseveral occasions freely admitted into the ports of Colonies of ALABAMA CLAIMS.\nGreat Britain, instead of being proceeded against, as it ought to\nhave been, in any and every port within British jurisdiction\nin which it might have been found;\" 4. And because \" the\nGovernment of her Britannic Majesty can not justify itself for\na failure in due diligence on the plea of the insufficiency of the\nlegal means of action which it possessed.\"\nAs to the Florida, originally called Oreto, the Tribunal decides that the British Government failed to\nuse due diligence to fulfill its duties:\n1. Because \"it results from all the facts relative to the construction of the Oreto in the port of Liverpool, and to its issue\ntherefrom, which facts failed to induce the Authorities in Great\nBritain to resort to measures adequate to prevent the violation\nof the neutrality of that nation, notwithstanding the warnings\nand repeated representations of the Agents of the United\nStates;\" 2. Because \"it likewise results from all the facts relative to the stay of the Oreto at Nassau, to her issue from that\nport, to her enlistment of men, to her supplies, and to her armament with the co-operation of the British vessel Prince Alfred\nat Green Cay, that there was negligence on the part of the\nBritish Colonial Authorities ;\" 3. Because, \" notwithstanding\nthe violation of the neutrality of Great Britain committed by\nthe Oreto, this same vessel, later known as the Confederate\ncruiser Florida, was nevertheless on several occasions freely\nadmitted into the ports of British Colonies;\" and, 4. Because\n\" the judicial acquittal of the Oreto at Nassau can not relieve\nGreat Britain from the responsibility incurred by her under the\nprinciples of international law; nor can the fact of the entry\nof the Florida into the Confederate port of Mobile, and of its\nstay there during four months, extinguish the responsibility\nprevious to that time incurred by Great Britain.\nAs to the Shenandoah, originally called the Sea\nKing, the Tribunal decides that the British Government is not chargeable with any failure in the use of\ndue diligence to fulfill the duties of neutrality respect- 162\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ning her during the period of time anterior to her entry into the port of Melbourne: but\u2014\nI That Great Britain has failed, by omission, to fulfill the duties prescribed by the second and third of the Rules aforesaid,\nin the case of this same vessel, from and after her entry into\nHobson's Bay, and is therefore responsible for all acts committed by that* vessel after her departure from Melbourne, on the\n18th day of February, 1865.\"\nThe Tribunal further decides as to the Tuscaloosa,\ntender to the Alabama, and as to the Clarence, the\nTacony, and the Archer, tenders to the Florida:\n\"That such tenders or auxiliary vessels being properly regarded as accessories, must necessarily follow the lot of their\nprincipals, and be submitted to the same decision which applies to them respectively.\"\nAs to the other vessels accused, namely, the Retribution, Georgia, Sumter, Nashville, Tallahassee, and\nChickamauga, the Tribunal decided \" that Great Britain has not failed, by any act or omission, to fulfill\nany of the duties prescribed by the three Rules of\nArticle VI. in the Treaty of Washington, or by the\nprinciples of international law not inconsistent therewith.\"\nThus far the Tribunal had dealt only with the considerations of law and of fact applicable to the general question of the naked legal responsibility of Great\nBritain.\nAs preparatory to the ulterior question of the sum\nto be awarded to the United States by way of indemnity, the Tribunal decides; 1. \"That prospective earnings can not properly be made the subject of compen- ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n163\nsation, inasmuch as they depend in their nature upon\nfuture and uncertain contingencies;\" 2. \" In order to\narrive- at an equitable compensation for the damages which have been sustained, it is necessary to set\naside all double claims for the same losses, and all\nclaims for 'gross freights' so far as they exceed 'net\nfreights;'\" 3. \" It is just and reasonable to allow interest at a reasonable rate.\"\nFinally, the Tribunal, deeming it preferable, in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Treaty\nof Washington, to adopt the form of adjudication*of\na sum in gross rather than to refer the subject of\ncompensation to Assessors, concludes as follows:\n\"The Tribunal,making use of the authority conferred upon\nit by Article V1L of the said Treaty, by a majority of four\nvoices to one, awards to the United States the sum of fifteen\nmillions five hundred thousand dollars in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States for the\nsatisfaction of all the claims referred to the consideration of the\nTribunal, conformably to the provisions contained in Article\nV1L of the aforesaid Treaty.\n\" And, in' accordance with the terms of Article XL of the\nsaid Treaty, the Tribunal declares that' all the claims referred\nto in the Treaty as submitted to the Tribunal are hereby fully,\nperfectly, and finally settled.'\n\" Furthermore, it declares that each and every one of the said\nclaims, whether the same may or may not have been presented\nto the notice of, or made, preferred, or laid before the Tribunal,\nshall henceforth be considered and treated as finally settled,\nbarred, and inadmissible.\"\nIt deserves to be remembered that the British Arbitrator, and he alone, refused to sign the Decision.\n/ CD\nNo good reason appears to justify this refusal, seeing 164\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthat the signature is but authentication, and the body\nof the Decision sets forth all the differences of opinion\nexisting among the Arbitrators. Thus, Mr. Adams\nand Mr. Stsempili were overruled on two questions;\nand yet they signed the Act. So the Vicomte d'ltajuba was overruled on the great question of the liability of Great Britain for the Shenandoah; and yet\nhe signed the Act. In separating himself from his\ncolleagues in this respect, the British Arbitrator exhibited himself as what he was, as most of his actions in the Tribunal demonstrated,\u2014as his subsequent avowal established,\u2014not so much a Judge, or\nan Arbitrator, as the volunteer and officious attorney of the British Government.\nEFFECT OF THE AWARD.\nIn reflecting on this Award, and seeking to determine its true construction, let us see, in the first place,\nwhat it actually expresses either by inclusion or exclusion.\nThe Award is to the United States, in conformity\nwith the letter of the Treaty, which has for its well-\ndefined object to remove and adjust complaints and\nclaims \" on the part of the United States.\"\nBut the history of the Treaty and of the Arbitration shows that the United States recover, not for the\nbenefit of the American Government as such, but of\nsuch individual citizens of the United States as shall\nappear to have suffered loss by the acts or neglects\nof the British Government. It is, however, not a special trust legally affected to any particular claim or ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n100\nclaimants, but a general fund to be administered by\nthe United States in good faith, in conformity with\ntheir own conceptions of justice and equity, within\nthe range of the Award. If, according to any theory\nof distribution adopted by the United States, the\nsum awarded prove inadequate, we have no claim on\n#Great Britain to supply the deficiency: on the other\nhand, if the Award should prove to be in excess, we\nt are not accountable to Great Britain for any balance.\nOn this point, precedents exist in the diplomatic history of Great Britain herself.\nThe Tribunal does not afford us any rules of limitation affecting the distribution of the Award, unless in the declaration that \"prospective earnings,\"\n| double claims \" for the same losses, and \" claims for\ngross freights, so far as they exceed net freights,\" can\nnot properly be made the subject of compensation,\u2014\nthat is to say, as against Great Britain.\nNor does the Tribunal define affirmatively what\nclaims should be satisfied otherwise than in the comprehensive terms of the Award, which declares that\nthe sum awarded is \"the indemnity to be paid by\nGreat Britain to the United States for the satisfaction of all the claims referred to the consideration of\nthe Tribunal, conformably to the provisions contained\nin Article VII. of the aforesaid Treaty.\"\nThe Arbitrators,\u2014be it observed,\u2014do not say for\nthe satisfaction of certain specific claims among those\nreferred to the consideration of the Tribunal, but of\nI all the claims\" so referred conformably to the provisions of the Treaty. 166\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nNow, the practical question which arises is whether the schedules of claims, which were presented to\nthe Tribunal as documentary proofs on the part of\nthe United States, are conclusive, either as to what\nthey contain or what they do not contain, to establish\nrules of distribution under the Award.\nThis point is settled by what occurred in discus-,\nsions before the Tribunal.\nGreat Britain had presented a table, composed in\nlarge part of estimates, appreciations, and arbitrary\nor suppositious averages: in consequence of which\nthe United States presented other tables, to which\nthe British Agent objected that these tables comprehended claimants, and subjects of claim, not comprised\nin the actual schedules filed by the United States: to\nwhich the American Agent replied by showing that\nthe Tribunal had before it, in virtue of the Treaty,\nall the reclamations made by the United States in\nthe interest of individuals injured, and comprised under the generic name of Alabama Claims [le tribunal\nreste saisi de la question de toutes les reclamations\nfaites par les Etats-Unis dans l'interet des individus\nleses, et comprises sous le nom generique de reclamations de I Alabama].\nSome discussions on the same subject afterward occurred between Mr. Stseinpni and Sir Alexander Cockburn, which conclusively prove that the result reached\ndid not accept as binding either the tables presented\nby the United States or the deductions therefrom\nclaimed by Great . Britain. The estimate of Mr.\nStaernpfli seems to have been the basis of conclusion; pa\nALABAMA CLAIMS.\n167\nand that estimate is founded on dividing the difference between the American estimate of $14,437,000,\nand the British estimate of $7,074,000, the mean of\nwhich is $10,905,000: which mean does not in any\nsort represent the actual claims of the United States.\nIndeed, one of the Arbitrators expressly declared\nthat, in arriving at a conclusion, the Arbitrators were\nnot to be regarded as making an assessment, or confining themselves to the schedules, estimates, or tables\nof either of the two Governments.\nWhether the sum awarded be adequate, depends, in\nmy opinion, on whether distribution be made among\nactual losers only and citizens of the United States.\nALIDITY OF THE AWARD.\nThe principles of the Award are in conformity with\nthe Rules of the Treaty, which do but embody in precise language the traditional policy, inaugurated by\nWashington with the active support of Jefferson, professed by every successive President of the United\nStates, and authenticated by repeated Acts of Congress.\nThat Great Britain loyally accepts the Award, and\nwill in due time pay to the United States the amount\nawarded, it is impossible to doubt. The Queen's\nspeech, at the opening of the present session of Parliament, not only declares the acquiescence of the\nBritish Government in the Award, but also recommends speedy payment in conformity with the tenor\nof the Treaty.\nAnd while prominent members of both Houses, 168\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nsuch as the Earl of Derby, the Marquess of Salisbury,\nand Lord Cairns, in the House of Lords, and, in the\nHouse of Commons, Mr. Disraeli, Mr. Horsman, and\nothers, spoke complainingly of the Treaty, and of the\nnew Rules, rather than of the Award, yet Lord Granville, the Marquess of Ripon, and the Lord Chancellor, in one House, and Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Laing, Mr.\nLowe, and others, in the other House, defended the\nwhole transaction with its results, as alike beneficial\nto Great Britain and the United States.\nAmong the discontented persons is Mr. Laird, who\nfinds himself characterized as one of those who prefer\n\"private gain to public honor,\" and who seems to\nthink that the Government of that day did not investigate him and his family so much as it might and\nshould have done to the end of detecting and exposing the false pretenses with which they covered up\nthe illegal destination of the Alabama. Lord Redes-\ndale also continues to mourn over the insensj-bility\nof the British Government to his partnership argument, and refuses to be comforted, although the Government did, in fact, present the argument with all\npossible seriousness in the British Counter-Case and\nelsewhere, in season to have it distinctly responded\nto by the Counsel of the United States (Argument,\np. 479 and seq.), and considered or not considered by\nthe Tribunal.\nThe elaborate speeches of the Earl of Derby and\nMr. Disraeli sufficiently indicate the footing on which\nobjection to the Treaty and to the Award is to be\nplaced in England.    Little is said in criticism of the ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n169\namount awarded as indemnity. Earl Granville, indeed, does not fail to remind the Earl of Derby of the\nadmission made by the latter in the House of Commons, to the effect that the Americans were very\nlikely to establish their claims, or some of them at\nleast, and to get their money. This admission on the\npart of Lord Stanley evinced his manliness and truth-\n' fulness. Even the Chief Justice at Geneva was forced\nto concede the responsibility of Great Britain for the\nacts of the Alabama, and did not- very skillfully escape making the same concession as to the Florida.\nThe marvel is, that Lord Russell should have so\npersistently refused to agree to any terms of redress,\nwhen he himself could write to Lord Lyons on the\n27th of March, 1863, \" that the cases of the Alabama\nand Oreto were a scandal, and, in some degree, a reproach to our laws.\" I demand of myself sometimes,\nin reflecting on the strange obstinacy of Lord Russell\nin this respect, as contrasted with the conduct of the\nEarl of Derby, the Earl of Clarendon, and Earl Granville, whether there be not some mystery in the matter, some undisclosed secret, some unknown moral coercion, to account for and explain the conduct of Lord\nRussell ? The extraordinary incident of the failure\nof the Government to obtain from the Law Officers\nof the Crown any response to the call for their opinion in season to detain the Alabama,\u2014which incident\nSir Roundell Palmer vainly attempted to explain at\nGeneva,\u2014would really tend to make one suspect that\nsome member of the Government more powerful than\nhimself had defeated those good intentions of Lord. 170\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nRussell, with which he is credited by Mr. Adams.\nMay it not have been, must it not have been, Lord\nPalmerston? Is Earl Russell solely responsible for\nthe deplorable errors of that Administration ? *\n* I repeat, in Great Britain issue is not to be made on the\npecuniary part of the Award, but on the construction of the\nopinions expressed and the legal conclusions arrived at by the\nTribunal of Arbitration.\nThe opinions of aU the Arbitrators in the case of the Alabama, including that of the British Arbitrator, are concurrent to\nthe effect that, by reason of the mendacity of her builders, the\nLairds, co-operating with corruption, negligence, or stupidity\non the part of the Board of Customs, the British Government\nwas made responsible for the depredations committed by her\non the commerce of the United States.\nBut the circumstances of the a*ctual escape of the Alabama\nreveal a singular imperfection in the administrative mechanism\nof the British Government.\nOn the 23d of July, 1862, the British Government was\naroused from its indifference in regard to the equipment of the\nAlabama, by receiving from Mr. Adams, with some other\npapers, an opinion of a Queen's Counselor, Mr., now Sir Robert,\nCollier, to the effect that, if the Alabama were suffered to depart, the Board of Customs and the Government would incur\n\"heavy responsibility.\" The case had become urgent. The\nAlabama might sail at any moment. Lord John Russell hastened to hide himself under the robes of the \" Law Officers of\nthe Crown,\"\u2014that is to say, Sir John Harding, the Queen's Advocate-General ; Sir William Atherton, the Attorney-General;\nand Sir Roundell Palmer, the Solicitor-General.\nBut the oracles did not speak until the 29th of July, and\nthen advised detention ; in consequence of which, on the morning of that day, the Alabama, whose managers appear to have\nhad intimate knowledge of every step taken or not taken by\nthe Government, departed from Liverpool.\nLord John Russell, in a conference with Mr. Adams on the\n31st of July, imputed this misadventure to \" the sudden devel-1 ALABAMA CLAIMS.\nIt deserves to be noted in this relation that although Edwards and possibly some other of the pub-\nopment of a malady of the Queen's Advocate, Sir John D.\nHarding, which had utterly incapacited him for the transaction\nof business. This,\" he added, \" had made it necessary to call\nin other parties [he does not say, others of the Law Officers'],\nwhose opinion had been at last given for the detention of the\ngun-boat.\"\nThe Counsel of the United States, in their Argument, invite\nattention to the unsatisfactoriness of this explanation. They\nfound in the Documents annexed to the British Case eight\nopinions of the \" Law Officers of the Crown,\" prior to that of\nJuly 29th, all of which, except one dated June 30th, are signed\nby Sir John Harding, and also either by Sir William Atherton\nor by Sir Roundell Palmer. Thereupon, we inferred that the\nQueen's Advocate had become sick on or before the 30th of\nJune; and we also inferred that \" it was not necessary on the\n29th of July to call in new parties, bnt only to call upon the\nold.\" These inferences were legitimate, and were confirmed in\nthe sequel by the highest authority.\nBut thereupon the British Arbitrator, after speaking of the\nlast inference as \" an ungenerous sneer,\" remarks:\n\"The unworthy insinuation here meant to be conveyed is,\nthat Lord Russell stated that which was untrue,\u2014an insinuation which will be treated as it deserves by every one who\nknows him. It is obvious that Mr. Adams must, in this particular, have misunderstood his Lordship.\"\nThe Chief Justice unconsciously admits that if Lord Russell\nsaid this, \"he stated that which was untrue,\" and expects us to\ndisbelieve Mr. Adams in order to shield Lord Russell.\nI prefer to believe Mr. Adams. Nay, the statement imputed\nto Lord Russell by Mr. Adams is in substance reaffirmed and\nadopted in the British Case [p. 118].\nThe senseless prejudice which fills the mind of the Chief\nJustice in reference to the United States, their Agent, and their\nCounsel, is rendered the more conspicuous here by the fact\nthat, when he threw out this \" ungenerous sneer\" and this \" un- 172\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nlie officers, whose negligence or fraud has reflected so\nseriously on the British Government, may have been\nworthy accusation\" of his against the American Counsel, he had\nbefore him a statement on the subject, presented to the Tribunal of Arbitration by Sir Roundell Palmer, as follows:\nI Sir John Harding was ill from the latter part of June, 1862,\nand did not, after that time, attend to Government business.\nIt was not, however, known, until some weeks afterward, that\nhe was unlikely to recover; nor did the disorder undergo, till\nthe end of July, such a development as to make the Government\naware that the case was one of permanent mental alienation.\n\"Although, when a Law Officer was ill, he would not be\ntroubled with ordinary business, it was quite consistent with\nprobability and experience that, in a case of more than usual\nimportance, it would be desired, if possible, to obtain the benefit of his opinion. Under such circumstances, the papers\nw fluid naturally be sent to his private house; and, if this was\ndone, and if he was unable to attend to them, some delay would\nnecessarily take place before the impossibility of his attending\nto them was known.\n\"Lord Russell told Mr. Adams [July 31, 1862] that some\ndelay'had, in fact, occurred with respect to the Alabama in\nconsequence of Sir John Harding's illness. He could not have\nmade the statement, if the fact were not really so; because,\nwhatever the fact was, it must have been, at the time, known\nto him. The very circumstance that Sir J. Harding had not\nalready advised upon the case in its earlier stage might be a\nreason why it should be wished to obtain his opinion.\n\" Sir J. Harding and his wife are both [some years since]\ndead; so are Sir W. Atherton [the then Attorney-General] and\nhis wife; no information, therefore, as to the circumstances\nwhich may have caused delay, with respect to the delivery at\ntheir private house, or the transmission and consideration of\nany papers on this subject, can now be obtained from them.\n| The then Solicitor-General was Sir R. Palmer, who is able\nto state positively that the first time he saw or heard of the\npapers sent to the Law Officers [i. e., all three Law Officers] on ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n173\ndismissed, yet it does not appear that any of the\nguilty parties, such as Laird, Miller, Thomas, Prioleau,\nthe 23d and 25th or 26th of July, was on the evening of Monday, the 28th of July, when he was summoned by the Attorney-General, Sir W. Atherton, to consider them in consultation,\nand when the advice to be given to the Government was agreed\nupon.\" Sir R. Palmer thinks it his duty to add, that \" no Government ever had a more diligent, conscientious, and laborious\nservant than Sir W. Atherton; and that it is in the last degree\nunlikely that he would have been guilty of any negligence or\nunnecessary delay in the consideration of papers of such, importance.\"\nWe thus learn that in the latter part of June, as the American Counsel had supposed, Sir John Harding was unable to\nattend to the business of the Government. Next, we are informed that the papers might have been sent to his private\nhouse, to remain there unattended to; but it is not asserted that\nthey were so sent in fact. Nay, we are left to conjecture that\nthey might have been sent to the house of Sir William Atherton ; but it is not asserted that they were. Indeed, Sir Roundell\nPalmer speaks of \" the delivery at their private house,\" meaning apparently \" houses.\" Next, we are asked to believe that,\nbecause of the death of \" Sir J. Harding and his wife,\" and that\nof \" Sir W. Atherton and his wife,\" no means exist to explain\nthe fatal delay in this case, by reason of which so much loss\nand shame have been brought on Great Britain.\nWas it ever before imagined that the death of an Advocate-\nGeneral or an Attorney-General, and their wives, should leave\na Government wholly without means of knowledge on such a\nsubject, or should be put forward to explain such delay of action on the part of Ministers ?\nWho carried the papers to the house either of Sir John\nHarding or Sir William Atherton, or both ? Why did Lord\nRussell permit six days to elapse without inquiring for the answer to his reference when every hour was pressing for action ?\nWho brought the papers away from the place in which they\nwere, whether the house of Sir J. Harding, or the house of Sir 174\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nor other Englishmen, whose false representations deceived the British Government, and involved Great\nW. Atherton, if they ever went to either ? Why were they not\nsent to the house of Sir Roundell Palmer ? How did they ultimately get into the hands of Sir William Atherton and Sir\nRoundell Palmer ?\nNow, whatever Sir Roundell Palmer says I believe; and his\ndeclaration shows that there is no more reason to suppose the\npapers were sent, either to Sir J. Harding or to Sir W. Atherton, of which nothing is known, than that they were sent to\nSir R. Palmer himself, to whom we know they were not sent,\nas he positively declares.\nObserve that Sir R. Palmer takes pains to commend the diligence, conscientiousness, and industry of Sir W. Atherton, from\nwhich it is plain to infer \u00bbthat he never received the papers.\nOf course, the allusion to the death of him and his wife is as\nlittle to the purpose as that to the death of Sir J. Harding and\nhis wife, or the insanity of Sir J. Harding.\nAnother observation. According to Sir Roundell Palmer's\nstatement, there were two successive references to*the Law\nOfficers,\u2014on the 23d and the 25th or 26th. He implies that\neach of these references might have been communicated to Sir\nJ. Harding and to Sir William Atherton. He does not speak\nof the insane Sir J. Harding alone, as Lord Russell does; but\nis careful to make excuse in like manner for the sane Sir W.\nAtherton. Now, when he was called in for consultation on the\nevening of the 28th, did it not occur to him to inquire why\nthese sets of papers, each one of which ought to have been\ncommunicated to him at their respective dates, were not so\ncommunicated ? Why speculate on the effects of the insanity\nof Sir J. Harding or the integrity of Sir W. Atherton ? Why\nnot as well lay before us conjectural inferences founded on the\ndiligence or uprightness of him, Sir R. Palmer ? Should not the\nsuppression of the papers as to himself have suggested to him\nthat they had been suppressed as to Sir J. Harding and Sir W.\nAtherton ?\nWe revert now to Lord Russell's statement to Mr. Adams, ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n175\nBritain in this perilous controversy with the United\nStates, have ever been punished in any way.    Indict-\nthat the delay was caused by the insanity of Sir J. Harding,\nwhich made it necessary to call in other parties. What other\nparties ? Why, forsooth, the other two \" Law Officers of the\nCrown\" disguised by Lord Russell under the designation\n\"other parties.\" But Sir R. Palmer assures us that the papers [if, indeed, they were sent at all] must have been sent\noriginally \" to the Law Officers, i. e., all three Law Officers.\"\nLord Russell therefore had no more right to impute the delay\nto Sir J. Harding than to Sir W. Atherton; for, even to this\nday, Sir R. Palmer can not say to which of the two, if to either, the delay is imputable. And yet Lord Russell implies\nthat the delay was occasioned by the insanity of Sir J. Harding, while neither he nor Sir R. Palmer ventures to affirm that\nthe papers were ever sent to Sir J. Harding.\nIn view of all these imperfect and irreconcilable statements,\nthe presumption remains that some person in the Government\nhad the means of traversing its intention, and withholding\nthese papers from all the three Law Officers until the Alabama was ready to sail. I do not say Lord Russell was that\nperson; but I think he knows who it was; and if he desires to\nvindicate his honor, of which he and the Chief Justice say so\nmuch, he will best do it, not by \" sneers\" at the American\nCounsel, but by disclosing the name of the person in. the Foreign Office who thus betrayed and dishonored the Government.\nAll questions depending on this incident are now terminated. But the incident itself has permanent value as illustrating the weakness of the British Government on the side\nof its so-called \" Law Officers,\"\u2014that is, busy members of the\nBar, distracted by their private practice, but in whose opinions the Government lives and moves; who have \"papers\nsent\" to them by the Government in every great emergency,\nwithout their being actual and ever present members of the\nGovernment, like the \" Law Officers \" of the United States.\nHere, in the United States, as in the case of the Maury, for\nwm 176\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nments were, indeed, found against some inferior persons, but not against the responsible authors of the\nloss and shame which the Alabama and the Florida\nbrought on Great Britain. Traces occasionally appear\nin the journals of London of some discontent on the\npart of tax-payers, who are now called on to respond\nto the United States for the dishonorable gains of\nthe Lairds and the Millers. Expressions of sentiment\nin this respect appear in the recent debates in the\nHouse of Commons. Indeed, if an account were taken\nof the injury inflicted on the British people by the\nactual losses in Confederate bonds purchased in Great\nBritain, and the profits lost on bonds of the United\nStates not purchased there and sold instead in Germany; the losses on British ships and cargoes captured in attempting to run the blockade of Southern\nports; the payment by the Government to the United\ninstance, \" papers are presented to the Secretary of State by\nthe British Minister on the 11th day of October, 1855, alleging unlawful equipment in violation of neutrality by that vessel; the papers are sent to the Attorney-General on the 12th,\nand on the same day orders are given by telegraph to embargo the vessel, and are actually executed on the 13th at New\nYork.\nMr. Fawcett has not without reason called the attention of\nthe House of Commons to this defect in the conduct of the law\nbusiness of the British Government. The reply that the Attorney or Solicitor General should be allowed to continue in\nprivate business, in order to possess competent knowledge for\nthe conduct of the business of the Government, is quite preposterous; it would be just as reasonable to insist that the\nLord Chancellor or the Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench\nmust continue at the Bar. ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n177\nStates of indemnity for the captures made by the Alabama, the Florida, and the Shenandoah; the rise in\nthe cost of cotton and naval stores, and the consequent losses jto commerce, to manufactures, and to labor, in Great Britain, occasioned by the prolongation\nof our Civil War: in reflecting on all this, it will be\nperceived that the hasty issue of the Queen's Proclamation, which gave to the Confederates a standing in\nGreat Britain, and the means and spirit to continue\nhostilities, was an ill-advised measure, hardly less injurious to Great Britain than it was to the United\nStates. These are matters which, as questions of diplomacy between the two Governments, the Treaty\nof Washington and the Award of the Tribunal close\nCD\nup; but they remain as historical facts, full of admonition to all Governments.   Discite justiUam moniti.\n11\nFILIBUSTER OBJECTIONS.\nDo the Rules, as construed by the Decision of the\nTreaty, disclose that due diligence, voluntary diligence, in the discharge of neutral duties, has relation\nto the exigency, and that the failure therein is not excusable by the insufficiency of statute means of action?\nSo thought Washington and Jefferson. They acted,\nwhen no statute existed. It avails nothing to say\nthat ours is a constitutional government, with legal\nforms which impede administrative action. If Congress has not imparted to the Executive adequate,\npowers,\u2014rif^ for want of such fit legislation, the Executive can not act effectively in some given cases to\nprevent illegal expeditions,\u2014if, in consequence there-\nM 178\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nof, the subjects of any friendly State are injured,\u2014if,\nin a word, we should be so foolish as to insist on\nthe privilege of possessing laws designedly imperfect,\nand which thus favor the violation of law, and which\nare insufficient to enable the President to discharge\nthe international obligations of the United States,\u2014\nthen it is proper that we should pay for the enjoyment of such a privilege by answering to any friendly\nPower for the injurious consequences of our self-imposed impotency to perform the necessary duties of\nan independent sovereign State.\nThere is no difficulty whatever in the question. If,\non the one hand, in the case of war between two\nother Powers, the United States desire and intend to\nbe neutral, it is to be hoped they will not suffer\nthemselves to be.misled by the interests of some shipbuilders, or the wild schemes of some band of adventurers, foreign or domestic, or even by the sentiment\nof sympathy for this or that foreign cause, into permitting violations of the law of the land and of the\nCD\nrights of other States. If, on the other hand, the\nUnited States at any time desire, or intend to go to\nwar with some foreign Power, whether for inducements of sentiment or for objects of ambition, it is to\nbe hoped they will manfully say so, in the face of the\nworld, and will not sneak into national hostilities by\nmeans of the expeditions or equipments of private\npersons, citizens or foreigners,, conducting war in disguise while the Government falsely pretends to be at\npeace. All such \"national activities,\"\u2014that is, acts\nof fUibusterism,\u2014whether fraudulently encouraged or \u00abt>\nALABAMA CLAIMS.\n179\ninsufficiently discouraged by any Government, are indeed fettered by the three Rules, as they were already, so far as morality or law could do it, being\nclassed by statute with piracy, perjury, arson, murder,\nand other kindred \" Pleas of the Crown.\" True, there\nis tendency of opinion in the United States, as there\nis in Great Britain, to think that all rebellion is presumptively wrong at home, and that all rebellion is\npresumptively right every where else; but that is a\ntheory which has its inconveniences. In a word, there\nis no possible view of the subject in which filibuster-\nism is not a crime and a shame, without even the\nmean excuse of possible but dishonorable benefits to\nthe United States. At all times, under all administrations, private equipments in our ports, for the purpose of hostilities against any country with which, we\nwere at peace, have been treated as what they are,\ncriminal violations of the law of the land and of the\nlaw of nations. Statesmen, jurists, and tribunals are\nall of accord on this point. Contracts for such equipments are \" so fraught with illegality and turpitude\nas to be utterly null and void.\" ... \" There can be no\nquestion of the guilt and responsibility of a Government which encourages or permits its private citizens\nto organize and engage in such predatory and unlawful expeditions against a State with which that Government is at peace.\" ... \" This principle is universally acknowledged by the law of nations. It lies at\nthe foundation of all Government. It is, however,\nmore emphatically true in relation to citizens of the\nUnited States.\"   Such was the doctrine of the United 180\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nStates of old: such is their doctrine now, neither\nmore nor less by reason of our negotiation with Great\nBritain.\nSALE  OF ARMS NOT AFFECTED B\u00a5 THE  TREATY OR THE\nAWARD.\nSome persons have supposed that the Treaty affects\nthe question of the sale of arms or munitions of war\nto a Belligerent. That is an error. * Wherever, as between the parties to the Treaty, the sale of arms was\nlawful before, it is lawful now; wherever it is unlawful now, it was unlawful before. That is a question\nto which the action of the German Embassador in\nGreat Britain during the late war, between France\nand Germany has drawn the attention of all Europe,\nand which is certain to acquire importance in any\nfuture great war; but it is not touched, in fact, by the\nTreaty of Washington, and did not come before the'\nTribunal of Geneva.\nQUESTION OF SUPPLEES OF COAL.\nOne specific objection to the Rules of the Treaty,\nand only one, of any apparent force, has passed under\nmy observation, that of the Austrian statesman, Count\nvon Beust: the suggestion, namely, as to the second\nOCD * \u2022/ *\nRule, relative to coaling and refitting in neutral ports,\nwhich, it is alleged, \" gives to England, through her\npossession of neutral stations in all parts of the world,\na palpable advantage over other States, which have\nnot the same facilities at command.\"\nThis objection is one of apprehension, rather than ALABAMA CLAIMS. 181\nof fact. When the United States and Great Britain\nshall, in conformity with the Treaty, bring the new\nRules to the knowledge of other maritime Powers,\nsuch Powers will of course present for consideration\nall proper objections or qualifications to those Rules.\nCount von Beust goes on to speak of the declaration made by Austria, Prussia, and Italy in 1866,\nwhich indicates that he was considering the subject\nin the relation of contraband rather than of simple refitting in neutral ports.\nBut the precise question of the supply of coal in\nneutral ports is not prejudged by the Treaty of\nWashington, nor by the opinions of the Tribunal of\nArbitration. The United States are quite as much\ninterested in having access to supplies of coal \" at neutral stations in all parts of the world \" as Austria, or\nPrussia, or Italy; and we may presume that Count\nSclopis did not fail to reflect on the interests of Italy\nin this behalf.\nOne of the \" Considerants \" of the Award had for\nits special object to prevent misconstruction of the\nsecond Rule.   We quote it as follows:\n\" In ^order to impart to any supplies of coal a character inconsistent with the second Rule, prohibiting the use of neutral ports or waters as a base of naval operations for a Belligerent, it is necessary that the said supplies should be connected with special circumstances of time, of persons, of place,\nwhich may combine to give them such character.\"\nCount Sclopis explains the force of the Decision as\nfollows:\n\" Quant a la question de l'approvisionnement et du charge-\nmen i de charbon, je ne saurais la traitor que sous le point de. 182\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nvue d'un cas connexe avec l'usage d'une base d'opeVations na-\nvales dirigees contre l'un des Bellig^rants, ou d'un cas flagrant\nde contrabande. de guerre. Je ne dirai pas que le simple fait\nd'avoir alloue une quantity de charbon plus forte que celle n6-\ncessaire aux vaisseaux pour regagner le port de leur pays le plus\nvoisin, constitue a lui seul un grief suffisant pour donner lieu a\nune indemnite. Ainsi que le disait le Chancelier d'Angleterre,\nle 12 Juin, 1871, a la Chambre des Lords, l'Angleterre et les\nEtatsUnis se tiennent egalement attaches au principe pratique\nqu'il n'y a pas violation du droit des gens en fournissant des\narmes aux Belligerants. Mais si cet exc6dant de proportion\ndans l'approvisionnement de charbon vient se joindre a d'autres\ncirconstances qui marquent qu'on s'en est servi comme d'une\nveritable res hostilis, alors il y a infraction a la deuxieme Regie\nde 1'Article VI. du Trait6. C'est dans ce sens aussi que le m&me\nLord Chancelier expliquait dans le discours precit6 la portee\nde la derniere parte de la dite Regie.\"\nThe same point is treated by Mr. Adams as follows:\n\" The supply of coals to a Belligerent involves no responsibility to the Neutral, when it is made in response to a demand\npresented in good faith, with a single object of satisfying a legitimate purpose, openly assigned.\n\" On the other hand, the same supply does involve a responsibility if it shall in any way be made to appear that the concession was made, either tacitly or by agreement, with a view\nto promote or complete the execution of a hostile act.\n\" Hence I perceive no other way to determine the degree of\nthe responsibility of a Neutral in these cases, than by an examination of the evidence to show the intent of the grant in any\nspecific case. Fraud or falsehood in such a case poisons every\nthing it touches. Even indifference may degenerate into willful negligence, and that will impose a burden of proof to excuse\nit before responsibility can be relieved.\"\nMr. Adams, it will be noted, dwells on the question of intent in this matter, as he does, indeed, in ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n183\neach one of his opinions, to the contrary of the line\nof reasoning followed by the British Arbitrator.\nFinally, in assenting to the Decision, the Viscount\nof Itajuba remarked that,\" with regard to the supply\nof coal, he is of opinion that every Government is\nfree to furnish to the Belligerents more or less of\nthat article.\"\nThus, the tenor of the Decision of the Tribunal,\nand the commentaries of the Arbitrators thereon,\ncombine to show, that the second Rule can not have\nthe effect ascribed to it by Count von Beust.\nBesides which, the latter greatly errs in supposing\nthat the numerous naval stations possessed by Great\nBritain in different parts of the globe give to her so\nmuch advantage to the prejudice of other maritime\nPowers. She pays dearly for such benefits as she\nherself derives from those establishments, in the cost\nof maintaining them, whether in peace or in war;\nand if, while in a state of neutrality herself, she refuses hospitality to others [and she must do it to all,\nif she does to one], she forces other Powers to acquire similar establishments to be conducted with\nequal exclusiveness, or she is constrained to incur the\nrisk of the charge of partiality as between several\nBelligerents. Hence, it is not for the interest of other Powers to overstretch the responsibilities of Great\n.Britain in this respect; and it is for her interest to\ndeal justly and impartially with such other Powers.\nGreat Britain was not condemned by the Tribunal\nbecause of the supply of coals to Confederate cruisers\nin her Colonial ports, nor merely because those cruis- 184\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ners were permitted to pervert the privilege of hospitality into making a base of operations of Nassau or\nof Melbourne. The recognized fault in the matter\nof the Shenandoah was mainly the augmentation of\nher crew at Melbourne, and the addition of equipments, without which she could not have operated as\na cruiser in the North Pacific. In the case of the\nAlabama, and especially that of the Florida, the\nfault was in allowing them to come and go unmolested, and even favored, in the Colonial ports, when the\nBritish Government could no longer pretend to be\nignorant of their originally illegal character, nay,\nwhen it was now fully aware of what Mr. Adams\ncalls the \" continuous, persistent, willful, flagrant falsehood and perjury,\" and the \" malignant fraud,\" which\nattended the equipment of the Confederate cruisers\nin Great Britain. It was this class of facts, and not\nany such secondary consideration as the supply of\ncoal, which turned the scale against Great Britain in\nthe opinions of the Arbitrators.\nNo: neither the Treaty of Washington, with its\nRules, nor the Decision of the Tribunal of Geneva,\nhas inaugurated any new policy of neutrality in the\nUnited States, nor created for them any rights or\nany duties not previously possessed by and incumbent on the Government.\nWHAT THE UNITED STATES HAVE GAINED BY THE AWARD.\nWhat, then, it may be asked, have the United\nStates gained by the Treaty of Washington, and by\nthe Arbitration ? ALABAMA CLAIMS.\n185\nWe have gained the vindication of our rights as\nO CD\na Government; the redress of the wrong done to our\ncitizens; the political prestige, in Europe and America, of the enforcement of our rights against the most\npowerful State of Christendom; the elevation of\nmaxims of right and of justice into the judgment-seat\nof the world; the recognition of our theory and policy of neutrality by Great Britain; the honorable conclusion of a long-standing controversy and the extinction of a cause of war between Great Britain and\nthe United States; and the moral authority of having accomplished these great objects without war, by\npeaceful means, by appeals to conscience and to reason, through the arbitrament of a high international\nTribunal.\nThat war, the great curse and scourge of mankind,\nwill utterly cease because of the present successful\ninstance of international arbitration, nobody pretends.\nQuestions of national- ambition or national resentment,\u2014conflicts of dynastic interest,\u2014schemes of territorial aggrandizement,\u2014nay, deeper causes, resting\nin superabundant population or other internal facts\nof malaise, misery and discontent,\u2014will continue to\nproduce wars to the end of time.\n\"Non, sans doute,\" says M. de Mazade,\u2014speaking of the\nacts of the Tribunal,\u2014\" la guerre n'est point bannie de ce\nmonde, elle n'est pas remplacee par un tribunal de conciliation faisant rentrer au fourreau les epees impatientes d'en sor-\ntir: ce n'est pas moins un ev6nement caracteristique et heu-\nreux que le succ6s de ce tribunal d'equit\u00a3, de cette sorte de justice internationale.\" . . .\nWe, Great Britain and the United States, have in\n; 1:\n\u25a0 f,!

As Lord Ripon truly says, in so doing, we have taken a great\nstep in the direction of the dearest of all earthly\nblessings, the blessing of peace.\nLet us hope tljat other nations may follow, in our\nfootsteps. Great Britain, to her honor be it said, has\nbeen true in this respect to the engagements she entered into at the Conferences of Paris. If we of the\nBritish race are more capable of reasoning in the\nmidst of passion than others,*then ours be the glory.\nIn all this, the sacrifices of *feeling have been on\nthe side of Great Britain. We owe the acknowledgment to her, in all sincerity. Standing, as we now\ndo, side by side, with every cloud of offense removed\nfrom between us,\u2014-two peoples, as Mr. Gladstone has\nwell said, on whom the seal of brotherhood has been\nstamped by the hand of the .Almighty himself,\u2014we\nmay proudly point in unison to the homage we have\nboth rendered to the cause of peace and humanity\nin the hall of arbitration at Geneva. MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS.\n187\nCHAPTER HI.\nMISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS.\nTREATY PROVISIONS.\nThe Treaty goes on to provide, in Articles XII. to\nXVH inclusive, that all claims on the part of corporations, companies, or private individuals, citizens of\nthe United States, upon the Government of Great\nBritain, arising out of acts committed against the\npersons or property of citizens of the United States,\nduring the period between April 13,1861, and April\n9,1865, inclusive, not being claims growing out of the\nacts of the vessels referred to in the previous articles\nof the Treaty; and all claims, with the like exception, on the part of corporations, companies, or private\nindividuals, subjects of Great Britain, upon the Government of the United States, arising out of acts committed against the persons or property of subjects of\nGreat Britain during the same period, shall be referred to three Commissioners to be appointed, one by\neach of the two Governments, and the third by the\ntwo Governments conjointly: these Commissioners\nto meet at Washington, there to hear, examine, and\ndecide upon such claims as may be presented to them\nby either Government.\nThe stipulation, it will be perceived, does not cover 188\nTHE TREATY OF WASHTNGTON.\nall existing claims of citizens or subjects of the one\nGovernment against the other, but only claims for\nacts committed against persons or. property on either\nside between certain defined dates,\u2014that is, during\nthe pendency of actual hostilities in the United States.\nIt is a provision, supplementary in effect to the preceding clauses of the Treaty, conceived in the apparent intention of thus closing up all subjects of contention growing out of our Civil War.\nThe Commission was duly organized by the appointment of Mr. Russell Gurney, Commissioner on\nthe part of Great Britain, and Mr. James S. Frazer,\non the part of the United States, and of Count Corti,\nEnvoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary\nof Italy, Commissioner named conjointly by the two\nGovernments.\nThe Treaty contains detailed provisions for the\nprosecution of the business before the Commission, to\nbe completed within two years from the day of their\n'first meeting; and the contracting parties engage to\nconsider the decision of the Commissioners absolutely\nfinal and conclusive on each claim decided by them,\n\u2014to give full effect to such decision without any ob-\njection, evasion, or delay whatsoever,\u2014and to consider every claim comprehended within the jurisdiction\nof the Commissioners as finally settled, barred, and\nthenceforth inadmissible, from and after the conclusion of the proceedings of the Commission.\nThe Commissioners assembled at Washington on\nthe 26th of September, 1871, and are assiduously engaged in the determination of the claims submitted MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS.\n189\nin conformity with the Treaty, having before them as\nAgent for the United States, Mr. Robert S. Hale; as\nAgent for Great Britain, Mr. Henry Howard; with\nMr. James M. Carlisle as Counsel, and Mr. Thomas C.\nCox, Secretary to the Commission.\nThe Commission will undoubtedly complete its duties within the time prescribed by the Treaty.\nPRIVATE CLAIMS ON GOVERNMENTS.\nThe intimate relation, which exists between the\ndifferent States of Christendom at the present time,\nhas resulted in the necessity of providing special\nmeans for adjudicating the private claims of the citizens or subjects of one Government against another.\nIt is one of the incidents of the gradual tendency of\nmodern nations to substitute reason for force, and arbitration for war.\nThe subject has not yet obtained from publicists\nand legislators the attention which, by reason of its\ngreat practical importance, and its intrinsic interest\nas an element of civilization, it deserves. It may\nwell receive consideration here, both in itself and in\nits relation to other congenial stipulations of the\nTreaty of Washington.\nAll the Powers of Christian Europe and America\nare of accord, and stipulate in their treaties of amity\nand commerce, to permit to one another's subjects\nfree ingress, residence, sojourn, and traffic in their\nrespective territories, on the same footing with the\ninhabitants thereof, and with subjection to the laws\nof the land, more or less complete, according to local\nto\u2014 190\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nregulations and to the tenor of treaties. Total exemption from the local law is maintained only by the\nsubjects of Christian States in countries outside of\nChristendom.\nIn most of the countries of Christendom foreigners\nare protected in their personal rights equally with\nthe inhabitants, and, if wronged, have access to the\ntribunals for redress, even against injuries by the local Government itself.\nGenerally, indeed, it may be said, with truth, that\nthe rights of a foreigner are better protected than\nthose of the inhabitants of the country itself; for, in\naddition to the tribunals of the country where he sojourns, the foreigner has the benefit of the Minister\nand Consuls of his own country.\nOf this favor the foreigner has occasional need, it\nis true; but it is a privilege susceptible of great\nabuse, by reason of the extravagant pretensions occasionally made by persons who may suffer any real or\napparent wrong, and who are prone to elevate trivial\ngrievances into international questions, to the annoyance of all Governments, and to the peril of the public peace. Most of such subjects of complaint are\ncapable of being settled by the local tribunals, and\nought to be. The laws of Rome lie at the foundation of the jurisprudence of all Europe and America\nalike; the forms of judicial administration are substantially similar in all the States of both Continents;\nand in many of the cases of alleged wrong to foreigners, and of call for diplomatic intervention, the affair\nis one which, if at home in his own country, the party MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS.\n191\nwould never dream of withdrawing from the courts\nCD\nof law to make the alleged injury a subject of claim\nagainst his Government. And it would greatly tend\nto the harmony of States and the peace of the world,\nif treaty stipulations were entered into in order to diminish the extent and restrain the frequency of such\nprivate claims on foreign Governments.\nIn the present condition of things, every Government is forced by private importunity into becoming\ntoo often the mere attorney of the claims of its citizens against foreign Governments, in matters where\nthe party aggrieved, if aggrieved, has ample means of\nredress before the tribunals, and where his grievance\ndoes not in the slightest degree affect the honor of his\nown Government.\nThese observations apply especially to incidents\noccurring in times of peace, in. which times the acts of\nwillful injury, done by any Government to foreigners\nsojourning under its treaty protection, are few in\nnumber compared with the injuries done to its own\nsubjects or citizens, by any, the best administered\nGovernment either of Europe or America. On such\noccasions, the injured party not seldom exaggerates\nhis case, and, by appeals to the sentiment of citizenship in his own country, seeks to force his Government to interpose in his behalf, so as to obtain for him\nsummary redress by diplomatic means in disregard\nof the local law.\nMeanwhile, in times of war, the resident or sojourning foreigner is still more solicitous to be exempt from\nthose ordinary consequences of military operations to\nbi_ 192\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nwhich the inhabitants of the country are subject, and\nhis solicitude is in proportion to the injuries to which\nhe is thus exposed. This fact became conspicuous\nin the late war between Germany and France, and led\nto many complaints on the part of British subjects\nvoluntarily residing at the seat of war, which constrained Lord Granville to disabuse them of the idea\nthat armies in the field were to fold their arms and\ncease to act, lest by chance they might, in the heat of\naction, disturb the peace of mind, or damage the property or person, of some commorant Englishman.\nIncidents of this nature are most of all frequent in\ntimes of civil war, especially in those countries of\nSpanish America, where militarism prevails, and the\nregular march of civil institutions is interrupted by\nmilitary factions headed by generals, in contention\nwith one another, and with the constituted authorities\nof the Government.\nFor injuries thus done to its subjects, residing or\nsojourning in a foreign country, every Government\npossesses of course the right of war or of reprisals,\nwhich, in effect, is the same thing, being the adoption\nof force as a remedy in lieu of reason: a method of\nredress for private injuries, which, however common\nformerly, is contrary to all the prevalent notions of\ninternational justice in our day.\nHence, while it is the right and duty of every Government to interpose on proper occasion, through its\nMinisters or Consuls, or otherwise, on the happening\nof any injury to its citizens or subjects abroad, yet\nthe recurrence to force as a means of redress is admis- MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS.\n193\nsible only in very, rare and exceptional cases of aggravated wrong committed by the authorities of the\nforeign Government.\nCD\nThe Government aggrieved in the person of its\n\u2022subject obtains, in many cases, the redress of the particular injury by more or less earnestness of diplomatic remonstrance.\nIf, however, redress be delayed for some sufficient\ncause to excuse the delay, and cases of alleged injury\nare thus accumulated, indemnity for the injuries done\nwill be procured by diplomatic negotiation, if the injured Government be patient and persistent; for,\nmuch as there may be of evil in the world, and fre-\nquently'as nations depart on occasion from the rule\nof right, yet, after all, the sense of justice among men\nand the conscience of nations prevail to such extent\nthat, in the end, in most cases, mere appeals to reason\nsuffice to obtain voluntary reparation at the hands of\nthe injuring Government.\nThus, without war, and without threat of war, the\nUnited States have obtained, by treaty, payment of\nindemnity, for injuries to citizens of the United States,\nfrom other Governments, such as France, Denmark,\nthe Two Sicilies, Spain, with provision for the distribution of such indemnity, among our citizens, by ourselves, through the agency of commissioners appointed\nunder Act of Congress.\nUSEFULNESS OF MIXED COMMISSIONS.\nIn other controversies of this class between the\nUnited States and foreign Governments, where agree-\nN 194\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nment as to the nature of the injury or amount of\nthe indemnity could not be arrived at, mixed commissions have been established by treaty in numerous instances, to judge and decide the questions at issue between the two contending Governments.\nOn three several occasions, within a brief period,\nthe United States and Great Britain have .had recourse to the international tribunal of a mixed commission for settlement of unliquidated claims of citizens or subjects of one country against the Government of the other, namely, by the Treaty of July 26,\n1853; by that of July 1,1863; and by the present\nTreaty of Washington. Other examples of this occur\nin our earlier history. And the United States have\nhad treaties of a similar character with the Mexican\nRepublic, with the Republic of New Granada, with\nthat of the United States of Colombia, and with the\nRepublics of Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Peru.\nAn eminent French publicist, M. Pradier Fodere,\nobserves:\n\"L'arbitrage, tres-usite dans le moyen-age, a ete\npresque entierement neglige dans les temps modernes;\nles exemples d'arbitrage offerts et acceptes sont deve-\nnus de plus en plus rares, par l'experience des incon-\nvenients qui semblent etre presque inseparables de ce\nmoy en, ordinairement insuftisant par le defaut d'un\npou^oir sanctionnateur.

It is that question of good faith among nations upon which the peace of the world stands.\nUndoubtedly, cases occur in which the international discord or debate turns on questions where the national honor or dignity is directly in play, and where\nthe controversy becomes a matter of personal sentiment; and in such cases it may not be easy to obtain an agreement to arbitrate. Such, indeed, was the\nview of Earl Russell, as we have already seen, with\nreference to the imputed want of due diligence of the\nBritish Government in the matter of the Alabama\nand the Florida. But the influence of time, which\nsoftens sensibilities and resentments, and the prevalence at length of the muipal desire of peace, may\novercome even the most serious apparent obstacles\nto friendly arbitration, as the conduct of Great Britain in expressing her regret for the incidents of which\nthe United States complained, and in referring the\nwhole subject to the Tribunal at Geneva, seems to\ndemonstrate.\nOTHER FORMS OF ARBITRATION.\nMany instances have occurred in the present century of another form of arbitration, differing materially\nfrom mixed commissions, namely, submission to a single arbiter or tribunal, with complete authority to\ndecide the subject of controversy.\nThus, in 1851,France and Spain referred to the ar- 196\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nbitration of the King of the Netherlands the question\nof responsibility for certain prizes; an incident of the\nintervention of France in the affairs of Spain in the\ntime of Ferdinand VII. In 1827, Great Britain and\nthe United States referred a question of boundary to\nthe King of the Netherlands. In 1843, France and\nEngland submitted a question of indemnities claimed\nby British subjects to the King of Prussia. In 1844,\nFrance and Mexico submitted a similar question to\nthe Queen of Great Britain. In 1852, the United\nStates and Portugal submitted to the Emperor of the\nFrench the question of the responsibility of Portugal\nfor the destruction of an American letter-of-marque\nby the English in the port of Fayal. In 1858, the\nUnited States and Chile submitted a question of private loss to the decision of the King of the Belgians.\nIn 1862, a difference between some English officers\nand local Brazilian authorities was submitted to thev\narbitration of the King of the Belgians by Great\nBritain and Brazil. In 1867, Great Britain and Portugal submitted a question of territory to the decision\nof the United States. In 1870, Brazil and the United\nStates referred a question of damages to the decision\nof Sir Edward Thornton, the British Minister. In\n1864, Great Britain and Peru submitted a question\nof private claims to the judgment of the Senate of\nthe free city of Hamburg.\nWe shall presently have to speak of a fact of the\nsame class in the question referred by Great Britain\nand the United States to the Emperor of Germany\nby the Treaty of Washington. MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS. 197\nOne of the earliest of our conventions of this nature\nwas contained in the Treaty of 1818, in execution of\nan article of the Treaty of Ghent [1815], by which\nthe United States and Great Britain stipulated to refer a certain question of indemnities to some friendly Sovereign or State. Afterward the Emperor of\nRussia was selected as such arbitrator, and rendered\nan award against Great Britain, in general terms, by\nreason of which it became necessary to provide by a\nsecond treaty [1822] for the appointment of a commissioner and arbitrator on the part of the United\nStates, and a commissioner and arbitrator on the part\nof Great Britain, to assemble at Washington and as-\nsess damages under the umpirage of the Minister of\nthe mediating Power accredited to the United States.\nThis example is curious and instructive, seeing that\nthe debtor Government, so to speak,\u2014Great Britain,\u2014\nin order to give effect to its engagement at Ghent\nentered into three successive international compacts\nwith the United States,\u2014one to appoint an arbiter,\nanother to name him, and a third to give effect to his\naward. There could be no better illustration of the\nmoral force of treaties of arbitration in the estimation\nof modern States.\nTENDENCY   OF REASON  AND  JUSTICE   TO  PREVAIL  OVER\nFORCE.\nThese many examples, it seems to me, tend to manifest the increasing desire of modern nations to terminate all their controversies, if possible, by friendly\nmeans rather than by force.    Where thev can not\nI 198\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nagree between themselves, they establish a mixed\ncommission or appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators.\nOn such occasions the contending parties do not select an arbitrator in consideration of his being powerful, like an Emperor of the French or an Emperor of\nGermany, but because of confidence in the impartiality of the arbiter, as when great States refer a question to relatively feeble Sovereigns, like the King of\nthe Netherlands or the King of the Belgians, or to\nCD CD *\nthe Senate of a little Republic like Hamburg, or even\nto five individual judges, like the Arbitrators of Geneva, or to a single person like Sir Edward Thornton.\nNay, in further proof of the availableness of this\nmethod of settling national disputes, we have Great\nBritain and the United States, in spite of their own\nparticular quarrel, each trusting the other in a question between either of them and another Power.\nThe same disposition of mind on the part of modern Governments, that is, the assumption that a selected international judge or arbitrator will decide\nimpartially, whether he be powerful or. weak, and of\nwhatever nationality he may be, appears in the constitution of mixed commissions. Generally these\ncommissions consist of two commissioners, one appointed by each of the respective Governments, with\nauthority given to the commissioners to select an umpire to determine any differences which may arise between them; or sometimes the umpire is agreed on\nby the two Governments.\nNow, in the very heat of our late controversies with\nGreat Britain, we consented to accept the British MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS.\n199\nMinister, Sir Frederic Bruce, as umpire between us\nand the United States of Colombia. And at the same\nperiod of time, Great Britain accepted Mr. B. R. Curtis,\nof Massachusetts,* as umpire under the Treaty for settling the claims of the Hudson's Bay Company against\nthe United States. And in this case, be it remembered, the Commissioners, just men both, Sir John Rose\nand Mr. Alexander S. Johnson, agreed on their award\nwithout troubling Mr. Curtis.\nUnder the previous claims' Treaty between Great\nBritain and the United States, the two Governments\nin the first instance agreed on ex-President Van Buren\nas umpire, and, on his declining, they chose Mr. Bates,\nan American Banker residing in London.\nUnder the claims'Treaty between the United States\nand New Granada, an American, Mr. Upham, of New\nHampshire, was umpire; and another American, Dr.\nFrancis Lieber, of New York, under the recent Treaty\nbetween the United States and the Mexican Republic.\nStrongest of all is the case of the Treaty between\nParaguay and the United States, which submitted\ntheir controversy to an American citizen, Mr. Cave\nJohnson, of Tennessee, as sole arbiter, and he decided\nagainst the United States.\nIs it possible to misapprehend the moral of such\nfacts % In all these various aspects of the subject, do\nwe not perceive the sense of justice tending every\nday to penetrate deeper and deeper into the councils\nof nations, and the voice of reason, of which international law is the expression, influencing more and\nmore the action of Governments ? . 200\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nTHEORY OF ARBITRATION.\nSovereign States, it has been said, should be trusted to do justice spontaneously, and without humbling\nthemselves to be judged by an arbitrator. It might\nwith just as good reason be said that all men should\nbe trusted to do justice spontaneously, and without\nhumbling themselves to be judged by a tribunal.\nThe experience of mankind contradicts each of these\npropositions. Diverse views of the facts, and of the\nrules of right applicable to the facts, to say nothing\nof prejudice, passion, pride of opinion, are inseparable\nfrom human affairs, because they are conditions of\nthe human mind, influencing the actions. as well of\nmen in political society as of individual men. Admit that in a majority of cases reason will prevail to\nprevent or to settle controversies between individual\npersons; but reason does not suffice in all cases, and\nit is for such exceptional cases that tribunals of justice exist, without which, in the attempt of men to\nright themselves, society would be dissolved into a\nstate of anarchy and bloodshed. The considerations\nwhich recommend the establishment of tribunals having authority as such within the limits of each sovereign State, are still more cogent when applied to\nsovereign States themselves, which, having no common superior, must of necessity determine their differences by war, unless they accept the mediation of\nsome friendly Power to restore concord between them,\nor unless they recur to arbitration, by mutual consent,\nin one form or another according to circumstances, as MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS.\n201\nthe United States and Great Britain have done by the\nTreaty of Washington.\nSo many examples of arbitration between Governments, within a recent period, contribute to prove that\nM. Pradier Fodere errs in assuming that in our day\n\" offers of arbitration made and accepted are becoming\nmore and more rare.\" On the contrary, this method\nof terminating national differences may now be regarded as permanently fixed in the international jurisprudence of Europe and America.\nWISDOM OF THE PRESENT MIXED COMMISSION.\nI conclude, therefore, that the United States acted wisely in submitting the claims of British subjects to a mixed commission by the Treaty of\nWashington.\nSome persons in the United States, with disposition to criticise the Treaty of Washington, have suggested that this Commission may result in finding a\nlarge balance of many millions due from the United\nStates to Great Britain.\nI think the supposition is altogether gratuitous,\nand that no such considerable balance will be found\nto be due. If it should be so, however, the fact will\nin no sort detract from the credit belonging to the\nCD      CD\nTreaty. If the Government of the United States, in\nthe course of its efforts to suppress insurrection, shall\nhave done injury to the subjects of Great Britain for\nwhich we are justly responsible by the law of nations,\nit is altogether proper that we should pay whatever\nindemnity therefor may be found due by the judg- 202\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nment of a lawfully constituted international tribunal,\nsuch as the present Commission.\nCitizens of the United States are not slow to invoke the intervention of their Government in behalf\nof any American injured in the progress of civil war\nin other countries, and on such occasions to talk loudly of \" outrages to citizens:\" let us do as we would\nbe done by, and concede that Great Britain is entitled\nto judicial examination of the cases of her subjects\nalleging injury by the occurrences of civil war in the\nUnited States. THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY- LINE.\n203\nCHAPTER IV.\nTHE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY-LINE.\nPROVISIONS OF THE TREATY.\nThe Articles of the Treaty from XXXIV. to XLII.\ninclusive dispose of the long-standing dispute between the United States and Great Britain regarding\nthe true water-line by which the Territory of Washington is separated from Vancouver's Island.\nThe subject of the controversy,- and the agreement\nfor its termination, are set forth as follows:\n\" Whereas it was stipulated by Article I. of the treaty concluded at Washington on the 15th of June, 1846, between the\nUnited States and Her Britannic Majesty, that the line of\nboundary between the territories of the United States and those\nof Her Britannic Majesty, from the point on the forty-ninth\nparallel of north latitude up to which it had already been ascertained, should be continued westward along the said parallel of north latitude ' to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver's Island, and thence southerly, through the middle of the said channel and of Fuca Straits,\nto the Pacific Ocean;' and whereas the Commissioners appointed by the high contracting Parties to determine that portion\nof the boundary which runs southerly through the middle of\nthe channel aforesaid, were unable to agree upon the same;\nand whereas the Government of Her Britannic Majesty claims\nthat such boundary-line should, under the terms of the treaty\nabove recited, be run through the Rosario Straits, and the Government of the United States claims that it should be run\nthrough the Canal de Haro, it is agreed that the respective 204\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nclaims of the Government of the United States and of the Government of Her Britannic Majesty shall be submitted to the\narbitration and award of His Majesty the Emperor of Germany,\nwho, having regard to the above-mentioned Article of the said\nTreaty, shall decide thereupon, finally and without appeal,\nwhich of those claims is most in accordance with the true interpretation of the Treaty of June 15,1846.\"\nSubsequent articles prescribe that the question\nshall be discussed at Berlin by the actual diplomatic\nRepresentatives of the respective Governments, either\norally or by written argument, as and when the Arbitrator shall see\" fit, either before the Arbitrator himself, or before a person or persons named by him for\nthat purpose, and either in the presence or the absence\nof either or both Agents.\nA previous arrangement in a treaty negotiated by\nthe Earl of Clarendon and Mr. Johnson for referring\nCD\nthe subject to the arbitration of the Bresident of the\nSwiss Confederation had been rejected by the Senate\nof the United States, not on account of any objection\nto the particular arbitrator, but for other considerations.\nThere is good cause for the suggestion of Lord Mil-\nton that the Senate of the United States considered\nour \" right to the disputed territory so extremely clear\nthat it ought not to be submitted to arbitration.\"\nThat, indeed, is the tenor of Senator Howard's speech\non the subject, the publication* of which was authorized by the Senate. Such a view of a question of\nlight may be admissible on the part of a private individual, who, in a clear case, may prefer a suit at law\nin the courts of his countrv to arbitration: but it is THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY - LINE.\nwholly inapplicable to nations, which, if they can not\nagree and will not arbitrate, have no resource left\nsave war.\nBut this was not the only consideration which induced the Senate to refuse its assent to that treaty.\nThere were objections to the form of submission.\nHISTORY OF THE QUESTION.\nThe controversy to which these treaties refer is one\nof the leavings of the last war between the United\nStates and Great Britain, and has its roots far back in\nthe circumstances of the primitive colonization of\nNorth America by Europeans.\nWhen the Kings of the little island of Britain, in\nvirtue of some of their subjects having coasted along\na part of the Atlantic shores of America, assumed to\nconcede to the Colonies of Massachusetts and Virginia\ngrants of territory extending by parallels of latitude\nwestward to the Pacific Ocean, and covering the unexplored immensity of the Continent, and on the premises of sovereignty and jurisdiction as good as their\ntitle to the manor of East Greenwich in Kent,\u2014it\nwas only men's universal ignorance of geography\nwhich saved the act from the imputation of wild extravagance.\nBut such grants, and the pretensions on which they\nwere founded, were the logical consequence of the\ntheories of colonization and conquest pursued in the\nNew World by Spain, Portugal, and France, as well\nas England, and formed the basis of the power of\nGreat Britain in North America, and eventually of 206\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthat of the United States. It was the assumption\nthat discovery by any European State, followed by\noccupation on the sea-coast, carried the possessions\nof such State indefinitely landward until they met\nthe possessions of some other European State.\nAt the same time, France had entered into America\nby the waters of the St. Lawrence, had ascended that\nriver to the Lakes, had then descended by the Mississippi to tlje site of the future New Orleans, and had\nthus laid the foundation of a title not only to the explored territories watered by the St. Lawrence or in\nfront of it on the sea-coast, but also to undefined, because unknown, regions beyond the Mississippi.\nHence arose the first great questions of boundary\nin North America, those between England, France,\nand Spain, which were settled by the Peace of Utrecht.\nFrance retained possession of the territories on the\nSt. Lawrence and the Mississippi; whilst England\nretained her country of Hudson's Bay and her Provinces on the Atlantic coast, and acquired Nova Scotia\nand Newfoundland. [Treaty of Utrecht, March 31-\nAprilll,l7l3.]\nSubsequently, the fortunes of war made England\nmistress of the Canadian and coast establishments of\nFrance, leaving to the latter only the territory beyond\nthe Mississippi.    [Treaty of Fontainebleau, Nov. 3,\n176!\nan\nd Treaty of Paris, Feb. 10,1763.\"\nMeanwhile, Spain continued, with but brief interruption, in undisputed sovereignty of the two Flondas,\nand of the vast provinces of New Spain, of undefined\nextension west and north toward the Pacific THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY -LLNE.\n207\nThus, when the Thirteen Colonies obtained independence, and treated for the partition between them\nand Great Britain of the British empire in America,\neach took the part of which they respectively held\nconstructive jurisdiction, according to its recognized\nlimits in time of peace,\u2014that is to say, Great Britain\nretained for herself the territories which she had conquered from France, and relinquished to the Thirteen\nColonies all the territoiy which she had theretofore\nclaimed as hers against France by title of colonization\nand possession.\nThe new Republic thus became the sovereign of a\nmagnificent territory regarded in the comparison with\nEuropean standards of magnitude, and also of intrinsic value and resources unsurpassed by the possessions of any European State.\nBut, even with such limits, we felt cribbed and confined from the first: for the statesmen of the United\nStates had clear perception not only of what we possessed as territory, but also of what we needed to\npossess in order to be a first-rate Power in America.\nWe found ourselves blocked in on the North by\nthe British possessions, which also overshadowed us\non the East, and which were at that time of sufficient\nrelative strength to constitute an object of solicitude\nto us so long as they remained in the hands of Great\nBritain.\nWestward, we were hemmed in along the Mississippi by the French, who also held the mouths of\nthat river, and barred us from access to the sea in\nthat direction.\n;\nH' 208\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nOn the South, Spain shut us up on the side of the\nGulf of Mexico.\nIt was impossible in this state of things that the\nUnited States could attain the development to which,\nin other respects, they had the right to aspire, by reason of the fertility of their soil, their numerous rivers,\nand their commanding position in the temperate zone\nof America.\nBut the cession of Louisiana to the United States\nby the voluntary act of France,\u2014the most splendid\nconcession ever made by one nation to another,\u2014produced a revolution in the condition of America. We\nthus acquired territory of indefinite limits westward,\nwith such limits on the south as the pretensions of\nSpain would allow, and with limits north only where\nsuperior claim of right on the part of Great Britain\nintervened, namely, the parallel of forty-nine degrees\nestablished between France and Great Britain by the\nTreaty of Utrecht.\nPresident Jefferson lost no time in asserting the\nrights of the United States in the interior of the\nUnion, and at the same time acquiring knowledge of\nthe country by means of the celebrated expedition of\nLewis and Clark. TJieretofore the only knowledge\nwe possessed of the great chain of the Rocky Mountains, and of the country or even the name of the country of Oregon beyond, was founded on the narration\nof Jonathan Carver, or other information derived\nfrom the Indians.\nWe were thus enabled to comprehend the relation\nof Louisiana to the shores of the Pacific, and to see THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY-LINE.\n209\nthat the River Columbia,first entered by Captain Robert Gray of the American ship Columbia, of Boston,\nin 1792, and named by him, and afterward by the\nEnglish explorer, Captain Vancouver, was \" the great\nriver of the West,\" the Oregon of Carver.\nThat coast had already been explored with more\nor less of diligence by Spanish navigators, fitted out\nby the Viceroys of New Spain, who gave to many of\nthe islands, straits, and channels the names they still\nretain; and Spain, if any Power anterior to the United States, had title by discovery in those parts of\nAmerica.\nBut the earliest settlement on that coast was the\nfactory of Astoria at the mouth of the River Columbia, established by John Jacob Astor.\nThen came the war between the United States and\nGreat Britain: the first effect of which, as to the present question, was the military occupation of Astoria\nand of the country on the banks of the Columbia by\nBritish forces: subsequently to which, on the conclusion of peace, although Astoria was surrendered to us\nin obedience to the stipulations of the Treaty of Ghent,\nyet Great Britain set up claim to the valley of the\nColumbia as against the United States, and, indeed,\nto all the country intervening between the actual occupations of Spain to the south in California, and those\nof Russia to the north in Sitka.\nClaims of Great Britain in this quarter, with but\nweak foundation, had already been asserted against\nSpain to the south of the River Columbia.\nControversy on the subject between the United\nO 210\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nStates and Great Britain was suspended by the Treaty\nof October 20,1818. By that treaty it was stipulated that from the Lake of the Woods to the \" Stony\nMountains,\" the line of demarkation between the possessions of the two countries in America should be\nthe forty-ninth parallel of latitude westward to the\nStony Mountains.\nThe United States might well have insisted on proceeding due west from the most northwestern point,\nof the Lake of the Woods, the terminal point in that\ndirection of the Treaty of Independence, which is\nnearer the parallel of 50\u00b0; but, in early unsuccessful\nnegotiations on this subject under President Jefferson,\nwe had agreed to adopt the 49th parallel, and that\nagreement was renewed by the Treaty of 1818, in obedience to the assumption that this line had been established by the Treaty of Utrecht.*\n* The \"Treaty of.Peace and Amity\" between France and\nEngland contains the following provision [Art.

Archipelago, Prince\nof Wales Archipelago;\u2014but no British claims of\nprior exploration could prevail here against the\nclaims of possession as well as discovery presented\nby Russia.\nIn this treaty, each Government speaks as the proprietor and sovereign of the respective territories;\nand it is this treaty which defines and marks out the\nTerritory of Alaska, as now held by the United States\nunder recent cession from Russia.\nIn this condition stood the title for more than\ntwenty years: the United States claiming from the\n\u2022rv CD\nlatitude of 42\u00b0 to that of 54\u00b0 40', in virtue, first, of\ntheir own discoveries and settlement, and of the right\nof the extension of Louisiana until it should reach the 214\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nocean or some recognized possession of another Power,\nand, secondly, in virtue of the discoveries and rights\nof extension of Spain; and Great Britain claiming in\nvirtue of discovery and possession, and of rights of extension of her actual admitted possessions in America.\nThus we arrive at the question of what her actual\nadmitted possessions were: which is the key to the\nTreaty of June 15,1846, the interpretation of which\nwas referred to the Emperor of Germany.\nOn the restoration of Charles H., projects of colonization and of remote commercial or speculative enterprises, which had been suspended in England during the Civil War, began to be resumed with new\nzeal, comprehending as well the East as the West\nIndies.\nAmong the great territorial charters of that day,\none of the most interesting is that of the Hudson's\nBay Company, by which the King granted to sundry\npersons, including the Prince Rupert, the Duke of\nAlbemarle, the Earl of Craven, Lord Arlington, Lord\nAshley, Sir John Robinson, Sir Edward Hungerford,\nand others [in part, it will be perceived, the same persons who obtained a grant of the two Carolinas],\n\" The sole trade and commerce of all those seas, straits, bays,\nrivers, lakes, creeks, and sounds, in whatsoever latitude they\nshall be, that lie-within the entrance of the straits commonly\ncalled Hudson's Straits, together with all the lands and territories upon the countries, coasts, and confines of the seas, bays,\nlakes, rivers, creeks, and sounds aforesaid, that are not already\nactually possessed by or granted to any of our subjects, or\npossessed by the subjects ofany other Christian Prince or\nState, with the fishing of all sorts of fish, whales, sturgeons, and THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY-LINE:\n215\nall other royal fishes in the seas, bays, inlets., and rivers within\nthe premises and the fish therein taken, together with the royalty of the sea upon the coasts within the limits aforesaid, and\nall mines royal, as well discovered as not discovered, of gold,\nsilver, gems, and precious stones, to be found or discovered\nwithin the territories, limits, and places aforesaid, and that the\nsaid land be from henceforth reckoned and reputed as one of our\nPlantations or Colonies in America, called ' Rupert's Land.'\"\nThis concession was induced, as the preamble of\nthe charter sets forth, by the reason that the parties\n\" Have, at their own great cost and charges, undertaken an\nexpedition for Hudson's Bay, in the northwest part of America,\nfor the discovery of a new passage to the South Sea, and for\nthe finding some trade for furs, minerals, and other considerable\ncommodities, and by such their undertaking have already made\nsuch discoveries as do encourage them to proceed farther in\npursuance of their said designs, by means whereof there may\nprobably arise very great advantage to us and our Kingdom.\"\nThe Company's Charter, in common with others of\nthat period, conveyed to them the right to hold the\nterritory granted with all rights and jurisdictions appertaining thereto, as of the manor of East Greenwich in Kent; the Company became lords and proprietors of Rupert's Land on condition of a yearly\npayment to the Crown of \" two elks and two black\nbeavers;\" and no legal impediment existed to the establishment on Hudson's Bay of a local political government such as existed in Massachusetts or Virginia ; but, in reflecting on the slow growth of the British Colonies in the more temperate latitudes of North\nAmerica, it will be readily seen that no colonization\ncould be effected on the frozen and desolate shores\nof Hudson's Bay.    In effect, the Company very soon 216\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nresolved itself into a mere commercial undertaking\nfor trade in the furs of the vast region in the space\nbetween Canada or New France and the Arctic Sea,\ninhabited only by wandering.oands of Indians.\nWhen the great Succession War broke out, involving all Europe, it could not fail to reach America;\nfor the possessions of three of the four principal\nPowers engaged,\u2014France, Great Britain, and Spain,\n\u2014occupied alternate points on the coast of the Atlantic. The French, of course, endeavored to avail\nthemselves of the opportunity to drive out or to\nweaken the English on both sides of them, and especially in Rupert's Land, which they invaded and\npartly conquered, but restored by the subsequent\nTreaty of Utrecht.\nAfter this time, the Company, safe in its arctic solitudes, prospered without check for a century, filling\nRupert's Land with forts and factories, and engrossing the fur trade of North America.\nThereupon a rival Company entered the field, under the auspices of the Province of Canada, founding\nits enterprise on the assertion that Rupert's Land\nhad only a limited extension south and west, to cover no more than the water-shed terminating at Hud-\nCD\nson's Bay, with no rights or jurisdiction southward\nand westward to the great Lakes and the Rocky\nMountains.\nAfter a long and violent controversy, the Northwest Fur Company was by agreement of parties\nmerged to the Hudson's Bay Company.\nThe combined influence of the parties interested in. THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY-LINE.\n217\nthe aggregate Company enabled it to obtain for a\nterm of years, first in 1821, and afterward in 1838,\nexclusive right to trade with the Indians in certain\nparts of North America not belonging to Prince Rupert's Land.\nThe region of country thus opened by license exclusively to the Hudson's Bay Company is described\nin the license of 1838 as follows:\n\" The exclusive privilege of trading with the Indians in all\nsuch parts of North America to the northward and to the westward of the lands and territories belonging to the United States\nof America as should not form part of any of our provinces in\nNorth America, or of any lands or territories belonging to the\nsaid United States of America, or to any European Government,\nState, or Power.\"\nIn so far as these licenses affected only the region\nwest and south of Hudson's Bay depending on Lake\nWinnipeg, Lake Athabasca, the two Slave Lakes, and\nother lands east of the Rocky Mountains, they did\nnot concern the United States.\nBut in so far as they affected the region west of\nthe Rocky Mountains, such a license is in plain violation of treaties with the United States. The Queen\nof England could give a license in that region to the\nHudson's Bay Company exclusive of all other Englishmen; but she could not give any to exclude citizens\nof the United States. That, indeed, the grant does\nnot profess to do; but, in effect, it did that and more;\nfor in the hands of the Company it was \" a charter\nof licensed usurpation and pillage in the whole of\nthe described region of North America.\" - The Com-\nCD\npany established forts or posts at every eligible or\nfir 218\nTHE TREATY  OF WASHINGTON..\nstrategic point between the mountains and the shores\nof the Pacific; their servants killed the fur-bearing\nanimals; they cut and exported the timber; and,\nby means of its wealth and organization, the*Company monopolized the commerce and the resources\nsubstantially to the exclusion for a long time of the\npeople of the United States.\nBut at length some settlements of Americans had\nbeen commenced in Oregon; and the attention of\nCongress was called to the usurpations of the Hudson's Bay Company by Mr. Benton, Mr. Linn, and the\nwriter of these pages: in consequence of which steps\nwere taken to put an end to the joint occupation of\nOregon. In fact, the Company had now set up the\nmost extravagant pretensions, exaggerating a mere license to trade into a grant of proprietorship to the\nwhole of the immense region south and west of Rupert's Land, to the dissatisfaction of the people of\nCanada as well as of the United States. For it was\nthe interest of the Company to retain the whole\ncountry occupied by them in the condition of a mere\nhunting-field, and quite uninhabited except by vassal\nIndians: while the Canadians desired that it should\nbe opened to colonization, so as to add to the materi.\nal resources and political force of the Canadian Provinces. Parliamentary inquiry into the rights of the\nCompany was instituted; it was imperatively instructed by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton [afterward Lord\nLytton], Colonial Minister [whose dispatches show\nthat he was not less eminent as a statesman than as\na poet and a novelist], to desist from all general pre- THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY - LINE.\n219\ntensions of proprietorship founded upon license to\ntrade; its.license was revoked; it was compelled to\nyield up Oregon to the United States; and it was\nhalf-persuaded and half-constrained to sell its chartered rights to the Canadian Dominion, and to shrink\ninto comparative insignificance in America.\nWhen the Government of the United States entered into negotiations with Great Britain for termina-\nting the joint occupation of Oregon, the machinations\nof the Hudson's Bay Company were the great disturbing fact which for a long time prevented the conclusion of a treaty and its due execution.\nMeanwhile the two Governments, after extraordinary contention, at length arrived at a settlement of\nanother boundary question, which had remained open\never since the Treaty of Independence, namely, the\nboundary-line on the northeast between the British\npossessions and the United States [Treaty of November 20,1842].\nThe duration of the Treaty of 1818 was limited to\nten years. As the expiration of this time approached,\nthe American Government offered to settle the question of Oregon by extending the line of 49\u00b0 to the\n.Pacific Ocean, and announced this as \"our ultimatum.\"\nThe British. Government objected that this line would\ncut off the southern part of Vancouver's Island. We\nreplied by proposing to yield this part for an equivalent. But it was for the interest of the Hudson's\nBay Company, which was in practical possession of the\nwhole country, to defeat this attempt at settlement,\nand it was' defeated, and the United States reluctant- 220\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nly consented to the prolongation of the nominal joint\noccupation.\nBut the discussions in Congress heretofore mentioned, and the disposition of Americans to settle in\nOregon, had, in 1842,- rendered the joint occupation\nintolerable to the people of the United States, and\nthe negotiation for settlement was renewed on the\npremises of the 49th parallel. The baleful influence\nof the Hudson's Bay Company caused the negotiation\nto drag on for the period of four, years; when the\nTreaty of 1846 was at length concluded, yielding to\nGreat Britain the southernmost extremity of Vancouver's Island.\nIt Was the question of Vancouver's Island which\nchiefly occupied the succeeding negotiators. To run\nthe line on the 49th parallel to the sea, and \" thence\nby the Canal de Haro and Straits of Fuca to the\nocean,\" was Lord Aberdeen's proposition to Mr.\nMcLane. And the same understanding of the question,\u2014that is, to concede to Great Britain \" Vancouver's\nIsland, and nothing else south of latitude 49\u00b0,\"\u2014pervades the dispatches and debates on both sides. And\non such premises, notwithstanding much opposition\nin Congress and out of it, the United States acceded\nto these terms as a measure of peace and of conciliation toward Great Britain.\nBut strife was unexpectedly renewed two years\nafterward by Lord Palmerston, or by Lord John Russell, who had succeeded as Premier to Sir Robert Peejl,\nand their action has kept up dispute on the subject\nbetween the two Governments for more than twenty THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY - LINE.\n221\nyears solely on account of pretensions which ought not\nto have been raised, and the injustice of which has now\nat length been demonstrated by' the Award of the\nEmperor of Germany. If this Award be unwelcome\nto the people of Great Britain, no feeling of unkind-\nness in that respect should be attached by them to\nthe United States. The Canal de Haro was undoubtedly intended by the negotiators of the Treaty of\n1846 as the water-boundary in that quarter: that intention accords with the obvious and only reasonable\nsignification of the language of the treaty.\nTHE AWARD.\nThis conclusion is clearly and conclusively proved\nin the Memorial presented in the name of the American Government to the German Emperor. by the\nAmerican Plenipotentiary and Agent, Mr. George\nBancroft, and in his Reply to the Case of Great\nBritain.\nMr. Bancroft was pre-eminently fitted for the performance of this duty. Possessing intellectual qualities of a high order, \u2022and particular personal estimation\nat the Court of Berlin, he enjoyed the advantage of\nhaving been a member of the Cabinet under whose\nauspices the Treaty of 1846 was negotiated,\u2014of subsequently representing his Government at the Court of\nSt. James at the time when the present controversy\ncommenced,\u2014and of being thoroughly master of all\nthe older diplomatic incidents of the question by his\nstudies as the historian of the United States. Of the\nvalue of all these qualifications to his Government on 222\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nthe present occasion, we have the proof in two most\ncomplete and most convincing arguments which he\naddressed to the Emperor of Germany.\nThe Agent on the part of Great Britain was Admiral James C. Prevost, who had been the Commissioner of his Government, in association with Mr.\nArchibald Campbell, Commissioner of the United\nStates, for determining and marking the line of boundary prescribed by the treaty, and who, of course, possessed all the special knowledge requisite for the\npreparation of any possible argument in support of\nthe pretensions of Great Britain.\nThe Emperor, it appears, referred the arguments on\nDoth sides to three experts, Dr. Grimm, Dr. Kiepert,\nand Dr. Goldschmidt, personages among the most\neminent of his subjects in jurisprudence and in science, upon whose report he decided on the 21st of\nOctober, 1872, in the terms of the reference, that the\nclaim of the United States to have the line drawn\nthrough the Canal de' Haro is most in accordance\nCD\nwith the true interpretation of the treaty concluded\non the 15th of June, 1846, between Great Britain and\nthe United States.\n\" This Award,\" says the President's Message of December 2,1872,\" confirms the United States in their\nclaim to the important archipelago of islands lying\nbetween the continent and Vancouver's Island, which\nfor more than twenty-six years [ever since the ratification of the treaty] Great Britain had contested, and\nleaves us, for the first time in the history of the United\nStates as a nation, without a question of disputed THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY-LINE.\n223\nboundary between our territory and the possessions\nof Great Britain on this continent.\"\nIn recent debates in the House of Lords, the Earl\nof Lauderdale criticised the Treaty of Washington\nin severe terms, partly on * the assumption that the\nUnited States have in reserve new claims respecting\nthe northwestern boundary-line. He is mistaken.\nNothing remains but questions of hydrography for\nCommissioners to determine, which there is no difficulty in doing; and arrangements have already been\nmade by the two Governments for the appointment\nand organization of the requisite Commission.\nIn conclusion, let me say that Great Britain has no\ncause to regret the adverse conclusion of this contro-\nversy. The conditions of the Treaty of 1846 involved\npositive concession on the part of the United States,\nif not as to the general line, yet in giving up the\nwhole of the Island of Vancouver without any compensation. We certainly did not mean at the same\ntime to give up the important island of San Juan, and\nvarious other islands intervening between that and\nthe main-land, which would have been the effect of\nadmitting the Straits of Rosario as the water-bound-\nary. We knew that prior to and during the negotiations the Canal de Haro was expressly mentioned\nand always understood as the true channel, corresponding to the desire of the British Government to\nsecure Vancouver's Island.\nTo Great Britain it can be of no possible consequence which of the lines of boundary should be established.    What possessions remain to her on the 224\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nnorthwest coast of America, Vancouver's Island and\nBritish Columbia can not ever be of special importance to her either as a military post or as a colony.\nNor can they be of any military advantage to the\nCanadian Dominion, and may, on the contrary, constitute in her hands a temptation to needless expense\nin fortifications, notwithstanding which, owing to the\nremoteness of those countries by land and their inaccessibility to her by sea, the Dominion would find\nthem quite untenable in the presence of the powerful\nAmerican States on the shores of the Pacific Ocean.\nTo the United States, on the other hand, it is important to have had the question decided in our favor.\nWe are now a real power on the Pacific coast, which\nGreat Britain is not and can not be. Holding the\nTerritory of Alaska to the north of the British possessions, the Territory of Washington, the State of\nOregon, and the great and rich State of California\nCD * CD\nceded to us by the Mexican Republic, with the growing States and Territories on their rear, it would have\nbeen to us intolerable to be excluded from the great\nchannel between Vancouver's Island and the mainland, or to traverse it only under the guns of British\nfortresses on that island. Such a settlement would\nhave had in it the germs of war: the present affords\nassurance of stable peace.\nHappily the United States and Great Britain are\nnow delivered from the complications in their relations occasioned by the exorbitant power of the Hudson's Bay Company. By other provisions of the same\nTreaty of 1846, the United States had made to Great THE NORTHWESTERN BOUNDARY -LINE.\n225\nBritain the concession of recognizing certain pretensions of that Company in Oregon and Washington,\nfounded on mere encroachment, and, in order to be relieved of these pretensions, paying to the Company a\nsmall sum in satisfaction of its claims, about one tenth\nof what was demanded for it in the name of the British Government.\nLord Milton expresses the opinion that \" On a just\nand equitable solution of the so-called San Juan Water-\nboundary Question depends the future, not only of\nBritish Columbia, but also of the entire British possessions in North America.\" By \"just and equitable\nsolution\" he means, of course, decision in favor of\nGreat Britain. If the premises are correct, then the\nconsequences are a fact accomplished. But he overestimates the value of the Archipelago of San Juan to\nGreat Britain. His opinion assumes what is impossible, the acquisition of considerable intrinsic strength\non the part of British Columbia, sustained by railroad\nconnection with the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\nBut what would avail, in a military point of view, a\nrailroad running through a thousand miles of comes o\nparatively uninhabited country within easy reach at\nevery point to the armies of the United States % I\nthink the future of the British possessions in North\nAmerica depends on a different order of facts, of which\nsomething will be said in another chapter in speaking of the commercial relations of the United States\nand the Canadian Dominion*\nI\nm 226\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nCHAPTER V.\nTHE   FISHERIES.\nHISTORY OF THE QUESTION.\nThe Treaty of Independence was, I repeat, a virtual partition of the British Empire in America between the Metropolis and the Thirteen United Colonies. It was not a treaty founded on military possession : for the Colonies had no such possession save\n, along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, and Great\nBritain occupied several posts north and west of\nthe Ohio and on the Great Lakes. The theory of the\ntreaty was to recognize the Colonies as sovereign according to their political limits as fixed by charter\nand by the public law of England.\nIn conformity with this theory, the treaty stipulates that the United States shall continue in the enjoyment of the coast fisheries, as follows:\n\" Article HI. It is agreed that the people of the United States\nshall continue to enjoy unmolested the right to take fish of every kind on the Grand Bank, and on all the other banks of Newfoundland ; also in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and at all other\nplaces in the sea where the inhabitants of both countries used\nat any time heretofore to fish; and also that the inhabitants of\nthe United States shall have liberty to take fish of every kind\non such part of the coast of Newfoundland as British fishermen\nshall use [but not to dry or cure the same on that island] ; and THE FISHERIES.\n22^\nalso on the coasts, bays, and creeks of all other of His Britannic\nMajesty's dominions in America; and that the American fishermen shall have liberty to dry and cure fish in any of the unsettled bays, harbors, and creeks of Nova Scotia, Magdalen Islands, and Labrador, so long as the same shall remain unsettled;\nbut so soon as the same or either of them shall be settled, it\nshall not be lawful for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish at\nthe said settlement, without a previous agreement for that purpose with the inhabitants, proprietors, or possessors of the\nground.\" \u00ab\nNotwithstanding the absolute terms of this treaty\nin regard to the question of peace, there survived on\nboth sides so much of irritation, and so many points\nof mutual relation remained uncertain, that the treaty\nwas in some respects little more than a truce. We\nhad special cause to complain of the persistent occupation of northwestern posts by Great Britain, and its\neffect on the Indians within our lines. On the other\nhand, to say nothing of minor matters, when the wars\nof the French Revolution commenced, and the French\nRepublic undertook to use our ports as the base of\nnaval operations against Great Britain, the latter\nPower took umbrage of course; and it was only the\nfirm attachment of President Washington to peace,\nwhich prevented these difficulties from fatally embroiling the two countries, and which led to the conclusion of the Treaty of December 19, 1794, as the\nsimilar spirit of President Grant led to the conclusion\nof the Treaty of Washington.\nDuring the next ten years, the United States labored to maintain their neutrality in the presence of the\nuniversal war by land and sea which raged between\nthe great European Powers.    Both France and En- 228\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ngland gave to us good cause of rupture; we barely\nescaped war with France in 1798; we were forced\ninto war with England in 1812; and in the course\nof all these events the hand of the Government was\nrestrained, if not paralyzed, by the factious force of\nsympathies in the United States, on the one side for\nFrance and on the other for England. Hence, alike\nin the quasi *war with the former, and the declared\nwar with the latter, the results as to the United States\nwere uncertain, imperfect, trivial even, compared with\nthe great objects which might have been accomplished by united counsels.\nOn the side of France, however, it must be admitted that our disposition to avoid pushing matters to\nextremities contributed to gain for us the immense\nbenefit of the acquisition of Louisiana.\nAfterward, although the Berlin and Milan Decrees\nof France and the Orders in Council of Great Britain\nconstituted each alike good cause of war with either,\nyet the United States held back at vast sacrifice, until\ncontinued assertion of the right to impress seamen on\nboard of our merchant ships, and, indeed, to visit our\nships-of-war, and other exaggerations of belligerent\nright, forced us into war with Great Britain.\nThe treaty by which that war was concluded is,\none of the most unsatisfactory in the annals of the\nUnited State's. It was absolutely silent in regard to\nall the subjects of controversy which had occasioned\nthe war. Nothing is said of the belligerent encroach-\nments of Great Britain on the neutral rights of the\nUnited States, nothing of maritime search, nothing of THE FISHERIES.\n229\nthe impressment of real or pretended British subjects\non board ships of the United States. And it left\nroom, by its silence, for Great Britain to raise question of our right to participate in the coast fisheries,\nwhich question, although dealt with from time to time\nin successive treaties, has more than once seriously\nendangered the peace of the two Governments.\nDoes war have the effect of annulling all existing\ntreaties ? A general answer to this question is given\nby one of the most authoritative of modern publicists\n[Calvo] as follows:\n\" If the treaty of peace modifies anterior treaties, or expressly declares the renewal of them, the dispositions of the treaty\nof peace are thereafter to constitute the law; but if no particular mention is made in this respect, the anterior treaties must\nnecessarily continue to have full force and effect. In order\nthat they should be deemed definitively abrogated, it would\nbe requisite that they shall not only be suspended by the war\nbut annulled in fact, as in the case of treaties of alliance of\nwhich the raison d'etre ceases at the end of the war: it would\nbe requisite,- indeed, that their contents should be incompatible\nwith the' stipulations of the treaty of peace, which occurs, for\nexample, in what regards ancient treaties relative to the delimitation of frontiers between two States.\"\nThe Supreme Court of the United States lays down\nthe law as follows:\nI We think that treaties stipulating for permanent rights and\ngeneral arrangements, and professing to aim at perpetuity, and\nto deal with the case of war as well as of peace, do not cease\non the occurrence of war, but are, at most, only suspended\nwhile it lasts; and unless they are waived by the parties, or\nnew and repugnant stipulations are made, they revive in their\noperations at the return of peace.\"\nSuch has been the received doctrine in the United 230\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nStates, to the effect that war does not, as an absolute,\nuniversal rule, abrogate existing treaties, regardless\nof their tenor and particular contents; and it is the\nonly doctrine compatible with reason, justice, common-\nsense, and the diplomatic history of Europe.\nBut the British Government, in the celebrated dispatch to Mr. Adams of October 30, 1815, signed by\nLord Bathurst, and understood to be the composition\nof Mr. Canning, declared the position of Great Britain\nto be: \" She knows no exception to the rule that all\ntreaties are put an end to by a subsequent war between the same parties.\" This proposition, in its absoluteness of expression, if it is intended as an assertion of any established practice of nations, or any recognized doctrine of the law of nations, is unfounded\nand unauthorized. Many treaties are made precisely\nfor the case of war, and only become 'efficacious in\nvirtue of the existence of war. The assertion of Lord -\nBathurst is altogether too broad, as Dr. Bluntschli\ndemonstrates.\nNevertheless, acting on such extreme premises, Great\nBritain pretended that our rights of fishery had been\nabrogated by the war, and were not revived by peace;\nand that this effect was the true interpretation of the\nomission to mention the subject in the Treaty of\nGhent.\nThe Commissioners of the United States who negotiated the Treaty of Ghent were men of unquestionable patriotism and of the highest character and\nintelligence-, it would be out of place here to reopen\nthe dispute as to certain special causes of the failure THE FISHERIES.\n231\nof the Commissioners to secure in that treaty recognition of the fishery rights of the United States. But\nit is due to the memory of the American Commissioners, and especially to Mr. Gallatin, Mr. Adams, and\nMr. Bayard, to say that, in all the negotiation at Ghent,\nthey and their associates were hampered by the discouraged state of mind of the American Government,\nembarrassed, as it was, by political difficulties at\nhome, and alarmed, if not terrified, by the triumph of\nGreat Britain in Spain and France, and the total over-'\nthrow of Napoleon, which seemed to leave the British Government free to dispatch overwhelming forces\nof sea and land against the United States.\nThe autumn subsequent to those events was the\ndarkest period in the history of the country. Nothing but the shock produced by the great change in\nthe whole face of affairs in Europe could have extorted from the American Government those final instructions to our Commissioners, which authorized them\nto agree to the status quo ante bellum as the basis of\nnegotiation,\u2014which spoke of our right to the fisheries,\nand of our foreign commerce, in equivocal terms,\u2014\nand which, indeed, left the Commissioners free to conclude such a treaty as their own judgment should\napprove under existing circumstances, provided only\nthey saved the rights of the United States as an independent nation.\nHow different might and would have been those\nCD\ninstructions, had the Government but struggled on a\nlittle longer against the adverse circumstances of the\nhour!   Courage and procrastination would have made 232\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nus masters of the situation, and enabled us to dictate\nterms to Great Britain.\nRemember that the Treaty of Ghent was signed on\nthe 24th of December, 1814, and that the disastrous\ndefeat of the British forces attacking New Orleans occurred a fortnight afterward, on the 8th of January,\n1815. This event, if the negotiation at Ghent had\nremained open, could not but have strengthened the\nAmerican Government; and, two months later, all\nthe difficulties in its path would have been removed\nby the landing of Napoleon at Golf\u00abJouan [March 1,\n1815] and the renewal of the war in Europe.\nBut the pretension of Great Britain, that the war\nhad abrogated' any part of the Treaty of Independence, was evidently untenable; and the justice of\nthe cause of the United States was so manifest that,\nafter three or four years of discussion, the British\nGovernment agreed to the express recognition of our\nfishery rights as follows [Treaty of October 20,1818]:\n\"Whereas differences have arisen respecting the liberty\nclaimed by the United States, for the inhabitants thereof, to\ntake, dry, and cure fish on certain coasts, bays, harbors, and\ncreeks of His Britannic Majesty's dominions in America, it is\nagreed between the high contracting parties that the inhabitants of the said United States shall have, forever, in common\nwith the subjects of His Britannic Majesty, the liberty to take\nfish of every kind on that part of the southern coast of Newfoundland which extends from Cape Ray to* the Rameau Islands, on the western and northern coast of Newfoundland\nfrom the said Cape Ray to the Quirpon Islands, on the shores\nof the Magdalen Islands, and also on the coasts, bays, harbors,\nand creeks from Mount Joly, on the southern coast of Labrador, to and IJlrough the Straits of Belleisle, and thence north- ^\nTHE FISHERIES.\n233\nwardly indefinitely along the coast, without prejudice, how-\n\u2022 ever, to any of the exclusive rights of the Hudson's Bay Company. And thafi the American fishermen shall also have liberty, forever, to dry and cure fish in any of the unsettled bays,\nharbors, and creeks of the southern part of the coast of Newfoundland, hereabove described, and of the coast of Labrador;\nbut so soon as the same, or any portion thereof, shall be settled,\nit shall not be lawful for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish\nat such portion so settled, without previous agreement for such\npurpose with the inhabitants, proprietors, or possessors of the\nground. And the United States hereby renounce, forever, any\nbVberty heretofore enjoyed or claimed by the inhabitants thereof to take, dry, or cure fish on or within three marine miles\nof any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors of His Britannic\nMajesty's dominions in America, not included within the above-\nmentioned limits: Provided, however, that the American fishermen shall be permitted to enter such bays or harbors for the\npurpose of shelter and of repairing damages therein, of purchasing wood, and of obtaining water, and for no other purpose\nwhatever. But they shall be under such restrictions as may\nbe necessary to prevent their taking, drying, or curing fish\ntherein, or in any other manner whatever abusing the privileges hereby reserved to them.\"\nIn virtue of these treaty provisions, -citizens of the\nUnited States continued to fish on the coasts of the\nBritish Provinces without interruption for some, twenty years, when question was raised as to their right\nto fish within the bays or indents of the coast, in\nconsequence of an opinion of the Law Officers of the\nCrown that the expression \" three marine miles of\nany of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbors,\" within\nwhich citizens of the United States were excluded\nfrom any right of fishing on the coast of British America, intends miles \" to be measured from the headlands,\nor extreme points of land next the sea or the coast, or 234\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nof the entrance of bays or indents of the coast,\" and\nthat, consequently, American fishermen had no right\nto enter bays, there to take fish, although the fishing\nmight be at a greater distance than three miles from\nthe shore of the bay.\nThis opinion, be it observed, makes no distinction\nbetween close bays and open ones, large indents of\nthe coast and small ones, and, if carried into effect by\nthe British Government, would exclude citizens of the\nUnited States from a large part of the productive fishing-grounds on the coast of British America.\nNow, strange to say, this opinion of the Law Officers\nof the Crown is based on a mere blunder of theirs,\nor, to say the least, on a fiction, or a bald interpolation.\nAfter stating their conclusion, they assign, as the\nsole reason of it:\n\" As [that is, because] we are of opinion that the term ' headland ' is used in the treaty to express the part of the land\nwe have before mentioned, including the interior of the bays\nand the indents of the coasts.\"\nIt is not true that \"the term fheadland' is used in\nthe treaty to express the part of the land we have\nbefore mentioned.\"\nNeither the term \"headland\" nor any word of similar signification is to be found in the treaty. The\nLaw Officers of the Crown undertook to construe the\ntreaty without reading it, and by this presumptuous\ncarelessness caused\" the British Government to initiate a series of measures of a semi-hostile character,\nwhich came very near producing another war between Great Britain and the United States. THE FISHERIES.\n235\nIt may be quite admissible for the British Government, as they are accustomed to do, to throw\noff all their responsibilities on the \"Law Officers\nof the Crown,\" when the question is one of mere\ndomestic relation; but it is dangerous for that\nGovernment to do so in matters affecting other Gov-\nernments.\nWe have already had occasion to comment on the\nvery extraordinary circumstances attending the failure of the Law Officers of the Crown to report upon\nthe case of the Alabama, and its disastrous influence\non the conduct of the Government.\nAs to the opinion of the \"Law Officers of the\nCrown \" in construction of the fishery clauses of the\ntreaty of 1818, it is difficult to say which produced\nthe more amusement or amazement in the United\nStates, the fact that the \"Law Officers\" should interpolate a phrase into the treaty in order to give to\ntheir opinion its sole foundation to stand upon, or\nthat the British Government should placidly accept\nsuch fallacious and baseless reasoning without challenge, and proceed in obedience to it to 'enter into hostile maritime operations, and hurry on to the verge\nof war against the United States.\nAfter much agitation and discussion, however, the\nquestion was settled for the time being by articles\nof the Treaty of September 9,1854, commonly called\nthe Reciprocity Treaty, as follows:\n\"Article I. It is agreed by the high contracting Parties that,\nin addition to the liberty secured to the United States fishermen\nby the above-mentioned Convention of October 20, 1818, of\nI si 236\nTHE  TREATY OF  WASHINGTON.\ntaking, curing, and drying fish on certain coasts of the British\nNorth American Colonies therein defined, the inhabitants of\nthe United States shall have, in common with the subjects\nof Her Britannic Majesty, the liberty to take fish of every kind,\nexcept shell-fish, on the sea-coasts and shores, and in the bays,\nharbors, and creeks of Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,\nPrince Edward's Island, and of the several islands thereunto\nadjacent [and, by another article, Newfoundland], without being restricted to any distance from the shore, with permission\nto land upon the coasts and shores of those Colonies and the\nislands thereof, and also upon the Magdalen Islands, for the\npurpose of drying their nets and curing their fish; provided\nthat, in so doing, they do,not interfere with the rights of private property, or with British fishermen in the peaceable use\nof any part of the same coast in their occupancy for the same\npurpose.\n\"It is understood that the above-mentioned liberty applies\nsolely to the sea-fishery, and that the salmon and shad fisheries,\nand all fisheries in rivers and the mouths of rivers, are hereby\nreserved exclusively for British fishermen.\"\nSimilar provision was made in Article H., with like\nexception, for the admission of British subjects to\ntake fish on a part of the sea-coasts and shores of the\nUnited States.\nIt was further agreed that Commissioners should\nCD\nbe appointed, who shall\n\" Examine the coasts of the North American provinces and\nof the United States embraced within the provisions of the\nfirst and second articles of this treaty, and shall designate the\nplaces reserved by the said articles from the common right of\nfishing therein.\"\nBut these provisions were temporary only, being\nsubject to be terminated on a year's notice, after the\nexpiration of ten years, and the treaty was in fact THE FISHERIES.\n287\ndenounced on the 17th of March, 1865, and expired\non the 17th of March, 1866.\nIn truth, the United States had purchased the fishery provisions of this treaty by other provisions to\nthe effect that certain enumerated articles of the\ngrowth and produce of the British Colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward's\nIsland, and Newfoundland, or of the United States,\nshould be \" admitted into each country respectively\nfree of duty.\"\nBut the reciprocity here was nearly nominal, the\ngreat benefits of the provision inuring to the British\nColonies. The fisheries had come to be the incident\nof a larger question, namely, that of the terms of commercial intercourse between the United States and\nthe British Colonies in North America.\nDissatisfaction in the United States with this state\nof things led to the denouncement of the treaty, and\nto the revival of a controversy between the two Governments regarding the fisheries: which controversy\nwas terminated by the Treaty of Washington.\nPROVISIONS OF THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nBy Articles XVIH., XIX., and XX., the fishery\nstipulations of the Treaty of September 9, 1854, are\nin substance revived, with further provision for the\nappointment of a Commission to settle any outstanding question as to the \" places \" of fishery reserved by\neither Government.\nIt is further agreed that fish-oil and fish of all\nCD\nkinds, except fish of the inland lakes and of the riv- 238\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ners falling into them, and except fish preserved in oil,\nbeing the produce of the fisheries of the United \u25a0\nStates, or of the Dominion of Canada, or of Prince\nEdward's Island, shall be admitted in each country\nrespectively free of duty.\nThen follows:\n\"Article XXH Inasmuch as it is asserted by the Government of Her Britannic Majesty that the privileges accorded\nto the citizens of the United States under Article XVJIt. of\nthis Treaty are of greater value than those accorded by Articles XIX. and XXI. of this Treaty to the subjects of Her Britannic Majesty, and this assertion is not admitted by the Government of the United States, it is further agreed that Commissioners shall be appointed to determine, having regard to\nthe privileges accorded by the United States to the subjects\nof Her Britannic Majesty, as stated in Articles XIX. and XXI.\nof this Treaty, the amount of any compensation which, in their\nopinion, ought to be paid Iby the Government of the United\nStates to the Government of Her Britannic Majesty in return\nfor the privileges accorded to the citizens of the United States\nunder Article XVHI. of this Treaty; and that any sum of\nmoney which the said Commissioners may so award shall be\npaid by the United States Government, in a gross sum, within\ntwelve months after such Award shall have been given.\"\nThe Commissioners referred to in this article are\nto be appointed, one by each of the two Governments, and the third by the two Governments conjointly, or, in case of disagreement between them, by\nthe Minister at London of the Emperor of Austria\nand Hungary. The Commission is to sit at Halifax,\nin the Province of Nova Scotia.\nWith this provision ends the list of Governments\nconcerned in this truly international Treaty, which, in\nthe interests of peace, engages the co-operation of THE FISHERIES.\n239\neight sovereign States, namely, Italy, Switzerland,\nBrazil, Sweden and Norway, Spain, Austria and\nHungary, Great Britain, and the United States.\nPROBABLE AMOUNT OF INDEMNITY.\nThe peculiarity of the arrangement, we see, is that\nthe United States are to make compensation to Great\nBritain for any excess in value of the privileges of\nfishery accorded to the United States above those\naccorded to Great Britain. One party asserts, the\nother denies, such excess of value.\nThis question involves examination of facts, but it\nalso suggests inquiry of right.\nWhat are the privileges which the United States\nacquire under Article XVIII. of the Treaty of Washington ? Certainly not any which they possessed already.\nNow, in virtue of subsisting stipulations of the\nTreaty of 1818, we possessed the recognized right of\nfishery along the coasts, and in the bays, harbors, and\ncreeks of British North America, subject, in so far as\nregards the present question, only to the renunciation\nwhich we made in that treaty of the liberty previously enjoyed or claimed, to take, dry, or cure fish on\nor within three marine miles of the coasts, bays,\ncreeks, or harbors of certain defined parts of the\nshores of British America. The Treaty of Washington removes this limitation. Hereafter we are to\nfish on the sea-coasts and shores, and in the bays,\nharbors, and creeks, previously subject to limitation\nof three marine miles, \"without being restricted to\nI 240\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nany distance from the shore.\" But we are not required to pay for any relinquishment on the part of\nGreat Britain of the fictitious claim founded on the\nerroneous opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown,\nwhich, on the false assumption that \"headlands\" are\nmentioned in the Treaty of 1818, extends an imaginary line seaward three marine miles from each cape\nof bays and indents of the coast, joins the extremities\nof those two lines by a straight line, and then requires our fishermen to keep outside of this connecting line. Deluded by that opinion, the British Government, indeed, absurdly undertook to exclude us\nby force from the Bay of Fundy, but failed to maintain its pretension in that respect.\nWhat we purchase is the right to enter and fish within the three marine miles of the shores at the bottom\nof certain bays, harbors, and creeks (from which alone\nwe were excluded by the Treaty of 1818), disregarding wholly the opinion of the Law Officers of the\nCrown. Looking at the clause under consideration,\nin this its only proper light, it is plain that it can\nnot impose any serious charge on the United States. COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   241\nCHAPTER VI.\nCOMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.\nTREATY PROVISIONS.\nSundry stipulations of the Treaty which relate to\nrights of navigation, and of transport by land or water,\n\u2014to concessions of commercial intercourse and transit,\u2014or to the free interchange of objects of production,\u2014are divisible into, first, permanent provisions,\nand, secondly, temporary provisions.\n1. Of permanent provisions we have the following:\n[a] Great Britain engages that the navigation of\nthe River St. Lawrence, ascending and descending,\nfrom the point where it ceases to form the boundary\nbetween the two countries, shall forever remain free\nand open for the purpose of commerce to the citizens\nof the United States [Art. XXVI.].\nThe United States engage that the Rivers Yukon,\nPorcupine, and Stikine, in Alaska, ascending and descending from, to, and into the sea, shall forever remain free and open for the purpose of commerce to\nthe subjects of Great Britain [Art. XXVI.].\nRights of local police and regulation are reserved\nby each Government.\n[5] The United States engage that the subjects\nQ 242\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nof Great Britain shall enjoy the use of the St. Clair^\nFlats' Canal on terms of equality with the inhabitants\nof the United States [Art. XXVH.].\n[c] The United States engage to urge on the State\nGovernments, and Great Britain engages to urge on\nthe Dominion of Canada, to secure each to the subjects or citizens of the other the use on equal terms\nof the several canals connected with the lakes or rivers traversed by or contiguous to the boundary-line\nbetween the possessions of the high contracting Parties [Art. XXVII.].\nAll these are provisions which bring the United\nStates and.the Dominion of Canada into fixed relations independent of and superior to all questions of\nGovernments.\n2. Of temporary provisions we have the following:\n[a] The navigation of Lake Michigan is declared\nfree and open for the purposes of commerce to the\nsubjects of Great Britain [Art. XXVTH.].\n[5] Goods, wares, and merchandise arriving at the\nports of New York, Boston, Portland, or such other\nports as the President may designate, and destined\nfor the British possessions in North America, may be\nentered at the proper custom-house without payment\nof duties, and conveyed in transit through the territory of the United States [Art. XXIX.].\nAnd, in like manner, goods, wares, and merchandise\narriving at any of the ports of the British possessions\nin North America, and destined for the United States,\nmay be entered at the proper custom - house, and\nconveyed in transit without the payment of duties COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   243\nthrough the said possessions; and goods, wares, and\nmerchandise may be conveyed in transit without payment of duties, from the United States through the\nsaid possessions to other places in the United States,\nor for export from ports in the said possessions [Art.\nXXIX.].\nAll these rights of transit are, of course, subject to\nsuch regulations for the protection of the revenue as\nthe respective Governments may prescribe.\n[<?] Great Britain engages to urge on the Dominion\nof Canada and the Province of New Brunswick that\nno export duty or other duty shall be levied on timber cut in that part of the American territory in the\nState of Maine watered by the River St. John and its\ntributaries, and floated down that river to the sea,\nwhen the same is shipped to the United States from\nthe Province of New Brunswick.\n\\d~\\ Subjects of Great Britain may carry in British\nvessels, without payment of duty, goods, wares, or\nmerchandise from one port or place within the territory of the United States upon the St. Lawrence, the\nGreat Lakes, and the rivers connecting the same, to\nanother port or place within the territory of the\nUnited States, provided that a portion of such transportation is made through the Dominion of Canada\nby land carriage and in bond [Art. XXX.].\nCitizens of the United States may carry in United\nStates vessels goods, wares, or merchandise from one\nport or place within the British possessions in North\nAmerica to another port or place within the said\npossessions, provided that a portion of such transpor- 244\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\ntation is made through the territory of the United\nCD v\nStates by land carriage and in bond [Art. XXX.].\nThe United States engage not to impose any export\nduties on goods, wares, or merchandise- carried under\nthis article through the territory of the United\nStates: and Great Britain engages to urge the Do-\n7 CD     CD O\nminion of Canada and the other British Colonies not\nto impose any export duty on goods, wares, or merchandise carried under this article.\nIt being understood that these respective rights of\ntransit are to be regulated by the two Governments:\nand that on the part of the United States the right\nof transit will be suspended unless the Dominion of\nCanada should establish the exemption from export\nduties required, and unless the Dominion shall open\nits. canals on equal terms to citizens of the United\nStates, and unless the Dominion and the Province of\nNew Brunswick shall free from all duties the timber\ncut on the St. John in the State of Maine and exported to the United States [Arts. XXX. and XXXI.].\nAll the provisions of the Treaty from Articles\nXVTH. to XXI. inclusive, and Article XXX.,\u2014that is\nto say, the articles regarding the fisheries and recip*\n*/ ' ^D CD ST\nrocal right of transit,\u2014are to take effect so soon as the\nlaws required to carry them into operation shall have\nbeen passed by the Parliament of Great Britain, by\nthat of Canada, and by the Legislature of Prince Edward's Island, on the one hand, and by the Congress\nof the United States on the other.\nSuch assent having been given, such articles shall\nremain in force for the period of ten years from the mm\nCOMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   245\ndate at which they may come into operation, and further until the expiration of two years after either of\nthe Parties shall have given to the other notice of its\ndesire to terminate the same: which either may give\nat the end of the said ten years or at any time afterward [A.rt.XXXHI.].\nTemporary as these provisions .are, or at least terminable at the will of either Party, they are equitable\nin themselves, and advantageous both to the United\nStates and the Canadian Dominion; and, like the\npermanent provisions of the Treaty explained in this\nchapter, they tend to draw the two countries closer\nand closer together.\nThe germ of the Treaty of Washington, it is to be\nremembered, was the suggestion of the British Gov-\nJ CDCD\nernment through Sir John Rose, a former Canadian\nMinister, whose proposal related only to pending\nquestions affecting the British possessions in North\nAmerica, not Great Britain herself.\nWhat these questions were we partly understand by\nthe stipulations of the Treaty, the whole of which, except those growing out of incidents of the late Civil\nXT \u00a9 O\nWar, are of interest to Canada, including the maritime\nProvinces, primarily if not exclusively, although re-\nquiring to be treated in the name of Great. Britain.\nTo the arrangements actually made, Canada would\nhave preferred, of course, revival of the Elgin-Marcy\nReciprocity Treaty, involving the admission into each\ncountry, free of duty,\"of numerous articles, being the\ngrowtji and produce of the British Colonies or of the\nUnited States.   It was the desire of Canada to have 246\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nprovision made for alleged claims on account of the\nacts of the Fenians. But the United States would\nnot listen to either of these propositions: so that the\nDominion had opportunity to allege that she was\nsacrificed to the Metropolis, and thus to obtain, by\nway of compensation, the guaranty on the pant of the\nImperial Government of a large loan for the construction of the proposed trans-continental railway from\nthe Great Lakes to the Pacific Ocean.\nIn some respects, the arrangements we have been\nconsidering resemble those of the Reciprocity Treaty;\nbut they are much more comprehensive, and they are\nbetter in other respeets.\nWe have placed the question of the fisheries on an\nindependent footing. If the American fisheries are of\ninferior value to the British,\u2014which we do not concede,\u2014then we are to pay the difference. But the\nfishery question is no more to be employed by the\nDominion of Canada, as it has been heretofore, either\nas a menace or as a lure, in the hope of thus inducing\nthe United States to revive the Reciprocity Treaty.\nApart from other new provisions in the Treaty of\nWashington of less moment, there is the all-important\none, stipulating for reciprocal right of commercial\ntransit for subjects of Great Britain through the\nUnited States, and for citizens of the United States\nthrough the Dominion: in view of which Sir John\nMacdonald has no cause to regret his participation\nin the negotiation of the Treaty.\nSir Stafford Northcote, in the late debate en the\nQueen's speech, repels with force and truth the\nug- COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   247\ngestion of Lord Bury that the Treaty of Washington\nis unjust to Canada. He shows, on the contrary, that\nthe Treaty is beneficial and acceptable to the Dominion, specifying particulars, and citing the approbatory\nvotes of the legislative assemblies of the Canadian\nand maritime Provinces.\nBut the United States will never make another\ntreaty of reciprocal free importation, without including manufactures and various other objects of the\nproduction of the United States not comprehended in\nthe schedule of the Elgin-Marcy Treaty. In fine,\nCanada must expect nothing of this nature short of a\ntrue zollverein involving serious modifications of the\ncommercial relations of Canada to Great Britain.\nRELATION OF THE BRITISH PROVINCES TO THE UNITED\nSTATES.\n\u2022 The Dominion of Canada is one of those \" Possessions,\" as they are entitled, of Great Britain in America, which, like Jamaica and other West India Islands,\nhave ceased to be of any economic value to her save\nas markets,\u2014which in that respect would be of almost as much value to her in a state of independence,\n\u2014which she has invited and encouraged to assume\nthe forms of semi-independent parliamentary government,\u2014which, on the whole, are at all times a charge\nto her rather than a profit, even in time of peace,\u2014\nwhich would be a burden and a source of embarrass*\nment rather than a force in time of war,\u2014and which,\ntherefore, she has come to regard, not with complete\ncarelessness perhaps, but with sentiments of kindli- 248.\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nness and good-will, rather than of the jealous tena-\nciousness of sovereign power. When the Dominion\nshall express desire to put on the dignity of a sovereign State, she will not encounter any obstacles on\nthe part of the Metropolis.\nIn regard to the Dominion of Canada, as to the\nColonies of Australasia, the power of the Metropolis\nappears there chiefly in the person of the Governor,\nand in the occasional annulment of laws of the local\nlegislatures deemed incompatible with those of the\nEmpire. On the other hand, the Colonies, which have\nnecessary relations of their own with neighboring\nGovernments, as in the case of Canada relatively\nto the United States, can not treat thereon themselves, as their interests require they should, but\nmust act through the intervention of the Metropolis,\nwhich, in this respect, may have other interests of its\nown superior and perhaps injurious to those of the\nColonies.\nMeanwhile the Dominion has now to provide for\nthe cost of her own military defense, and that, not\nagainst any enemies of her own, but against possible\nenemies of the Mother Country. The complications\nof European or of Asiatic politics may thus envelop\nthe Dominion in disaster, for causes wholly foreign to\nher, as much so as if she were a sovereign State. In\nsuch an emergency, the Dominion would be tempted\nto assume an attitude of neutrality, if not of independence.\nAll these considerations show how slender is the\ntie which attaches the Dominion to Great Britain. COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   249\nThe entire history of all European Colonies in\nAmerica proves that the sentiment of nationality, that\nis, of attachment to the Mother Country, is very weak,\nand readily yields place to other 'sentiments of ambition, interest, or passion, so as to produce feelings of\nhostility between the inhabitants of the Metropolis\nand those of the Colonies more intense than such as\nexist between either of them and the inhabitants of\nother countries. This fact is particularly remarkable\nin the incidents of revolution in Spanish America, example of which we have now before the eyes in the\ninsurrection which rages in Cuba. But the same fact\nappears distinctly in the past history of British\nAmerica. And there is no reason to suppose that\nthe sentiment of mere loyalty, that is, political attachment to the Mother Country, is any more strong at\npresent in the Dominion of Canada than it formerly\nwas in the British Colonies now constituting the\nUnited States.\nM. H. Blerzy, in a very instructive essay on the\nColonies of the British Empire, discussing the question\nwhether the English beyond sea are likely to remain\nattached to England by recollections of family or of\ncountry, observes with great truth that \" the very\naptitude for colonization of which the English are\nso proud could not exist without implying a certain insouciance of family on their part and disdain\nof their native country.\"\nHow true is this remark! It is illustrated by\ncontrasting the devoted attachment of the French to\nCD\nFrance, who in our day send so few colonists to 250\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nAmerica, and those chiefly Basques, while hundreds\nof thousands annually emigrate from Great Britain.\nLoyal Canadians, that is, loyal to Great Britain,\nmust of necessity take into account this fact, which is\nof the very essence of British colonization in America. They are also compelled to regard another serious fact of the same order of ideas, namely, the continual emigration from Canada to the United States,\nnot only on the part of recent immigrants from Great\nBritain, but,\u2014which is more noticeable as a sign of\nthe times,\u2014the emigration of old Canadians, natives\nof the soil, in spite of all the efforts of the Government to check and discourage it.\nCD\nOn the other hand, the hi story of all European colonization shows that a time comes when the Mother\nCountry grows more or less indifferent to the fate of\nher Colonies, which time appears to have arrived in\nGreat Britain as respects the Dominion.\nWhen Canada complains [without cause] that\nher wishes have been disregarded and her interests\nprejudiced by the stipulations of the Treaty of\nWashington, the great organ of opinion in England\nreplies:\n\" From this day forth look after your own business yourselves: you are big enough, you are strong\nenough, you are intelligent enough, and, if there were\nany deficiency in either of these points, it would be\nsupplied by the education of self-reliance. We are\nboth now in a false position, and the time has arrived when we should be relieved from it. Take up\nyour freedom: your days of apprenticeship are over.\" COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.   251\nInstances might be cited of the expression of similar ideas in Parliament.\nLoyalists in Canada must remember another thing.\nMontesquieu, with the singular penetration which\ndistinguished him, perceives that England imparts to\nher Colonies \"la forme de son Government,\" by\nmeans of which \" on verroit se former de grands*peu-\nples dans les forets memes qu'elle enverroit habiter.\"\nBut the parliamentary form of Government, which\nhas contributed so greatly to the growth and.strength\nof British Colonies, gave to them facilities of successful rebellion,\u2014that is, of separation from the Metropolis,\u2014which no other form of government could impart, and the absence of which in Spanish America\n[and now in Cuba] has done so much to impede and\nobstruct their separation from Spain. We had experience of this in our Revolution, where each of the\nColonies had a governmental organization so com-\n\u00a9 CD\nplete that, in order to be independent de facto, it\nneeded only to ship off the British Governor. The\nsame fact was apparent in our Secession War, as M.\nde Tocqueville had predicted. And, at this time, the\nDominion of Canada needs only to substitute for a\nBritish Governor one of her own choice to become\na sovereign State organized as completely as Great\nBritain herself.\nThere is another class of considerations of great\nimportance.\nWar between the United States and Great Britain\nis now a contingency almost inadmissible as supposition, and so, of course, is war between the United 252\nTHE TREATY OF WASHLNGTON.-\nStates and Canada, a possession of Great Britain.\nNevertheless, the capability of a country to maintain itself by force, if need be, is one of the elements\nof its political life, and therefore can not be overlooked in considering the condition of the Dominion\nof Canada.\nH regard to Canada the inquiry is the more important, seeing that military force depends in part on\ngeographical facts, which, in her case, equally as to\npeace or war, and for the same reasons, place her at\ndisadvantage on the side of the United States.\nCD\nThe British possessions in North America, beginning with Newfoundland on the Atlantic Ocean, and\nending with Queen Charlotte's Island on the Pacific,\nextend across the continent in its broadest part, a\ndistance of 80\u00b0 of longitude, but in a high latitude,\noccupying the whole of the country north of the territory of the United States. The space thus described\nlooks large on the map; but the greater part of it is\nbeyond the limit of the growth of trees, and much of\nthe residue is too cold to constitute a chosen residence\nfor Europeans.\nIn a word,'the Dominion stretches along thousands\nof miles, without capability of extension on the one\nside, where it meets the frozen north, or on the other,\nwhere it is stopped by the United States. As a\ncountry, it resembles a mathematical . line, having\nlength without breadth.\nMeanwhile, owing to their internal position, their\nnorthern latitude, and the geographical configuration\nof the whole country, the two great Provinces of On- COMMERCIAL INTERCOURSE AND TRANSPORTATION.\ntario and Quebec have no access to the sea in the long\ntvinter, save through the United States.\nThus, if it be possible to conceive of two countries,\nwhich would appear to be naturally destined to constitute one Government, they are the United States\nand the British Provinces, to the special advantage\nof the latter rather than the former.\nWe therefore can afford to wait.  We have nothing\nCD\nto apprehend from the Dominion Pacific Railway: if\nconstructed, it will not relieve Ontario and Quebec\nfrom their transit dependence on the United States.\nWe welcome every sign of prosperity in the Dominion. With the natural limitations to her growth, and\nthe restricted capacity of her home or foreign markets, her prosperity will never be sufficient to prevent\nher landowners and her merchants from looking wist-\nfully toward the more progressive population and the\nmore capacious markets of the United States. Her\nconspicuous public men may be sincerely loyal to the\nBritish Crown; many of the best men of Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia were so at the opening\nof the American Revolution; but neither in French\nCanada, nor in British Canada, nor in the maritime\nProvinces, do any forces of sentiment or of interest\nexist adequate to withstand those potent natural and\nmoral causes, or to arrest that fatal march of events,\nwhich have rendered nearly all the rest of America\nindependent of Europe, and can not fail, sooner or\nlater, to reach the same consummation in the Dominion of Canada.\nThe spirit of independence is a rising tide, in Can- 254\nTHE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\nada as elsewhere in America, which you see in its results, if not in its progress. It is like the advancement\nof the sun in the sky, imperceptible as movement, but\nplain as to stages-and ultimate destination. It is not\nan effect actively produced by the United States. It\nis an event which we would not precipitate by violence\nif we could, and which we scarcely venture to say we\nwish for, lest in so doing we should possibly wound\nrespectable susceptibilities; but which we nevertheless expect to hail some day with hearty gratulation,\nas an event auspicious alike to the Dominion and to\nthe United States.\nIf Lord Milton's appreciation of the course of events\nbe correct,\u2014and no person has written more intelligently or forcibly on the British side of these questions than he,\u2014the consummation is close at hand.\nArguing from the British stand-point of the San Juan\nQuestion, he says:\n\" If Great Britain retains the Island of San Juan and the\nsmaller islands of the archipelago lying west of the compromise\nchannel proposed by Lord Russell, together with Patos Island\nand the Sucia group, she will preserve her power upon the\nPacific, and will not in any way interfere with or menace the\nharbors or seas which appertain to the United States. If, on\nthe other hand, these islands should become United States territory, the highway from the British possessions on the mainland will be commanded by, and be at the mercy of that\nPower.  ...\n\"Such a condition of affairs must inevitably force British\nColumbia into the United States federation; and the valuable\ndistrict of the Saskatchewan . . . must, ex necessitate rei, follow the fortunes of British Columbia.

M. the King\nof Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and H. M. the Emperor\nof Brazil, having respectively named their Arbitrators, to wit:\nHer Britannic Majesty:\nSir Alexander James Edmund Cockburn, Baronet, a Member of Her Majesty's Privy Council, Lord Chief Justice of England;\nThe President of the United States:\nCharles Prancis Adams, Esquire;\nHis Majesty the King of Italy: .\nHis Excellency Count Frederic Sclopis of Salerano, a Knight of the Order\n\u2022 of the Annunciata, Minister of State, Senator of the Kingdom of Italy;,\nThe President of the Swiss Confederation:\nMr. James Staernpfli;\nHis Majesty the Emperor of Brazil:\nHis Excellency Marcos Antonio d'Araujo, Viscount of Itajuba, a Grandee\nof the Empire of Brazil, Member of the Council of H. M. the Emperor\nof Brazil, and his Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in\nFrance;\nAnd the five Arbitrators above named having assembled at Geneva, in Switz--\nerland, in one of the Chambers of the Hotel de Ville, on the 15th of December,\n1871, in conformity with the terms of the Second Article of the Treaty of Washington of the 8th of May of that year, and having proceeded to the inspection 276\nAPPENDIX.\nand verification of their respective powers, which were found duly authenticated,\nthe Tribunal of Arbitration was declared duly organized.\nThe Agents named by each of the High Contracting Parties, by virtue of the\nsame Second Article, to wit:\nFor Her Britannic Majesty':\nCharles Stuart Aubrey, Lord Tenterden, a Peer of the United Kingdom,\nCompanion of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath, Assistant Under-\nSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs;\nAnd for the United States of America:\nJohn C. Bancroft Davis, Esquire;\nwhose powers were found likewise duly authenticated, then delivered to each of\nthe Arbitrators the printed Case prepared by each of the two Parties, accompanied by the documents, the official correspondence, and other evidence on which\neach relied, in conformity with the terms of the Third Article of the said Treaty.\nIn virtue of the decision made by the Tribunal at its first session, the Counter-Case, and additional documents, correspondence, and evidence, referred to in\nArticle IV. of the said Treaty, were delivered by the respective Agents of the\ntwo Parties to the Secretary of the Tribunal on the 15th of April, 1872, at the\n.Chamber of Conference, at the Hotel de Ville of Geneva.\nThe Tribunal, in accordance with the vote of adjournment passed at- their\nsecond session, held on the 16th of December, 1871, reassembled at Geneva on\nthe 15th of June, 1872; and the Agent of each of the Parties duly delivered to\neach of the Arbitrators and to the Agent of the other Party the printed Argument referred to in Article IV. of the said Treaty.\nThe Tribunal having since fully taken into their consideration the Treaty, and\nalso the cases, counter-cases, documents, evidence, and arguments, and likewise\nall other, communications made'to them by the two Parties during the progress\nof their sittings, and having impartially examined the same,\nHas arrived at the decision embodied in the present Award:\nWhereas, having regard to the Sixth and Seventh Articles of the said Treaty,\nthe Arbitrators are bound under the terms of the said Sixth Article,'' in deciding the matters submitted to them, to be governed by the three Rules therein\nspecified, and by such principles of International Law not inconsistent therewith as the Arbitrators shall determine to have been applicable to the case;\"\nAnd whereas the \" due diligence \" referred to in the first and third of the\nsaid Rules ought to be exercised by neutral Governments in exact proportion\nto the risks to which either of the belligerents may be exposed from a failure to\nfulfill the obligations of neutrality on their part;\nAnd whereas the circumstances out of whieh the facts constituting the subject-matter of the present controversy arose were of a nature to call for the\nexercise on the part of Her Britannic Majesty's Government of all possible solicitude for the observance of the rights and thedutie\\ involved in the Proclamation of Neutrality issued by Her Majesty on the 13th day of May,\"1861 ;\nAnd whereas the effects of a violation of neutrality committed by means of THE DECISION AND AWARD.\n277\nthe construction, equipment, and armament of a vessel are not done away with\nby any commission which the Government of the belligerent Power benefited\nby the violation of neutrality may afterward have granted to that vessel: and\nthe ultimate step, by which the offense is completed, can not be admissible as\na ground for the absolution of the offender; nor can the consummation of his\nfraud become the means of establishing his innocence;\nAnd whereas the privilege of exterritoriality accorded to vessels of war has\nbeen admitted into the law of nations, not as an absolute right, but solely as a\nproceeding founded on the principle of courtesy and mutual deference between\ndifferent nations, and therefore can never be appealed to for the protection of\nacts done in violation of neutrality;\nAnd whereas the absence of a previous notice can not be regarded as a failure in any consideration required by the law of nations in those cases in which\na vessel carries with it its own condemnation;\nAnd whereas, in order to impart to any supplies of coal a character inconsistent with the second Rule, prohibiting the use of neutral ports or waters as a\nbase of naval operations for a belligerent, it is necessaiy that the said supplies\nshould be connected with special circumstances of time, of persons, or> of place,\nwhich may combine to give them such character;\nAnd whereas, with respect to the vessel called the Alabama, it clearly results\nfrom all the facts relative to the construction of the ship at first designated by\nthe \"No. 290\" in the port of Liverpool, and its equipment and armament in\nthe vicinity of Terceira, through the agency of the vessels called the Agrippina\nand the Bahama dispatched from Great Britain to that end, that the British\nGovernment failed to use due diligence in the performance of its neutral obligations ; and especially that it omitted, notwithstanding the warnings and official representations made1 by the diplomatic agents of the United States during\nthe construction of the said \"No. 290,\" to take in due time any effective measures of prevention, and that those orders which it did give at last for the detention of the vessel were issued so late that their execution was not practicable ;\nAnd whereas, after the escape of that vessel, the measures taken for its pursuit\nand arrest were so imperfect as to lead to no result, and therefore can not be considered sufficient to release Great Britain from the responsibility already incurred;\nAnd whereas, in despite of the violations of the neutrality of Great Britain\ncommitted by the \"290,\" this same vessel, later known as the Confederate cruiser\nAlabama, was on several occasions freely admitted into the ports of Colonies of\nGreat Britain, instead of being proceeded against as it ought to have been in any\nand every port within British jurisdiction in which it might have been found;\nAnd whereas the Government of Her Britannic Majesty can not justify itself\nfor a failure in due diligence on the plea of the insufficiency of the legal means\nof action which it possessed;\nFour of the Arbitrators, for the reasons above assigned, and the fifth for reasons separately assigned by him, are of opinion,\nThat Great Britain has in this case failed, by omission, to fulfill the duties 278\nAPPENDIX.\nprescribed in the first and the third of the Rules established by the Sixth Article of the Treaty of Washington.\nAnd whereas, with respect to the vessel called the Florida, it results from\nall the facts relative to the construction of the Oreto in the port of Liverpool\nand to its issue therefrom, which facts failed to induce the Authorities in Great\nBritain Jo resort to measures adequate to prevent the violation of the neutrality\nof that nation, notwithstanding the warnings and repeated representations of the\nAgents of the United States, that Her Majesty's Government \"has failed to use\ndue diligence.to fulfill the duties of neutrality;\nAnd whereas it likewise results from all the facts relative to the stay of the\nOreto at Nassau, to her issue from that port, to her enlistment of men, to her\nsupplies, and to her armament with the co-operation of the British vessel Prince\nAlfred at Green Cay, that there was negligence on the part of the British Colonial Authorities;\nAnd whereas, notwithstanding the violation of the neutrality of Great Britain\n\u2022committed by the Oreto, this same vessel, later known as the Confederate cruiser\nFlorida, was nevertheless on several Occasions freely admitted into the ports of\nBritish Colonies;\nAnd whereas the judicial acquittal of the Oreto at Nassau can not relieve\nGreat Britain from the responsibility incurred by her under the principles of\nInternational Law; nor can the fact of the entry of the Florida into the Confederate port of Mobile, and of its stay there during four months, extinguish the\nresponsibility previously to that time incurred by Great Britain:\nFor these reasons,\nThe Tribunal, by a majority of four voices to one, is of opinion,\nThat. Great Britain has in this case failed, by omission, to fulfill the duties\nprescribed in the first, in the second, and in the third of the Rules established\nby Article VI. of the Treaty of Washington.\n'And whereas, with respect to the vessel called the Shenandoah, it results from\nall the facts relative to the departure from London of the merchant vessel the\nSea King, and to the transformation of that ship into a Confederate cruiser\nunder the name of the Shenandoah, near the island of Madeira,, that the Government of Her Britannic Majesty is not chargeable with any failure, down to\nthat date, in the use of due diligence to fulfill the duties of neutrality;\nBut \"whereas it results from all the facts connected with the stay of the Shenandoah at Melbourne, and especially with the augmentation which the British\nGovernment itself admits to have been clandestinely effected of her force by the\nenlistment of men within that port, that there was negligence on the part of the\nAuthorities at that place:\nFor these reasons,\nThe Tribunal is unanimously of opinion,\nThat Great Britain has not failed, by any act or omission, to fulfill any of .\nthe duties prescribed by the Rules of Article VI. in the Treaty of Washington,\nor by the-principles of International Law not inconsistent therewith, in respect THE DECISION AND AWARD.\n279\nto the vessel \"called the Shenandoah, during the period of time anterior to her\nentry into the port of Melbourne.\nAnd by a majority of three to two voices, the Tribunal declares that Great\nBritain has failed, by omission, to fulfill the duties prescribed by the second and\nthird of the Rules aforesaid, in the case of this same vessel, from and after her en-.\ntry into Hobson's Bay, and is therefore responsible for all acts 'committed by that\nvessel after her departure from Melbourne on the 18th day of February, 1865.\nAnd so far as relates to the vessels called\nThe Tuscaloosa\n(Tender to the Alabama),\nThe Clarence,\nThe Tacony, and\nThe Archer\n(Tenders to the Florida),\nThe Tribunal is unanimously of opinion,\nThat such Tenders or auxiliary vessels, being properly regarded as accessories, must necessarily follow the lot of their Principals, and be submitted to the\nsame decision which applies to them respectively.\nAnd so far as relates to the vessel called the Retribution,\nThe Tribunal, by a majority of three to two voices, is of opinion,\nThat Great Britain has not failed, by any act or omission, to fulfill any of\nthe duties prescribed by the three Rules of Article VI. in the Treaty of Washington, or by the principles of International Law not inconsistent therewith.\nAnd so far as relates to the vessels called\nThe Georgia,\nThe Sumter,\nThe Nashville,\nThe Tallahassee, and\nThe Chickamauga, respectively,\nThe Tribunal is unanimously of opinion,\nThat Great Britain has not failed, by any act or omission, to fulfill any of\nthe duties prescribed by the three Rules of Article VI. in the Treaty of Washington, or by the principles of International Law not inconsistent therewith.\nAnd so far as relates to the vessels- called\nThe Sallie,\nThe Jefferson Davis,\nThe Music,\nThe Boston, and\nThe V. H. Joy, respectively,\nThe Tribunal is unanimously of opinion,\nThat they ought to be excluded from consideration for want of evidence.\nAnd whereas, so far as relates to the particulars of the indemnity claimed by\nthe United States, the costs of pursuit of the Confederate cruisers are not, in\nthe judgment of the Tribunal, properly distinguishable frofn the general expenses of the war carried oft by the United States,\n\u00ab* PBSW\n280\nAPPENDIX.\nThe Tribunal is therefore of opinion, by a majority of three to two voices,\nThat there is no ground for awarding to the United States any sum by way\nof indemnity under this head.\nAnd whereas prospective earnings can not properly be made the subject of\ncompensation, inasmuch as they depend in their nature upon future and uncertain contingencies,'\nThe Tribunal is unanimously of opinion,\nThat there is no ground for awarding to the United States any sum by way\nof indemnity under this head.\nAnd whereas, in order to arrive at an equitable compensation for the damages which have been sustained, it is necessary to set aside all double claims for\nthe same losses, and all claims for \"gross freights\" so far as they exceed \"net\nfreights;\"\nAnd whereas it is just and reasonable to allow interest at a reasonable rate;\nAnd whereas, in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of\nWashington, it is preferable to adopt the form of adjudication of a sum in gross,\nrather than to refer the subject of compensation for further discussion and deliberation to a Board of Assessors, as provided by Article X. of the said Treaty:\nThe Tribunal, making use of the authority conferred upon it by Article VII.\nof the said Treaty, by a majority of four voices to one; awards to the United\nStates the sum of fifteen millions five hundred thousand Dollars in gold as the\nindemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States for the satisfaction\nof all the claims referred to the consideration of the Tribunal, conformably to\nthe provisions contained, in Article VH. of the aforesaid Treaty.\nAnd, in accordance with the terms of Article XL of the said Treaty, the Tribunal declares that all the claims referred to in the Treaty as submitted to the\nTribunal are hereby fully, perfectly, and finally settled.\nFurthermore, it declares that each and every one of the said claims, whether\nthe same may or may not have been presented to the notice of, made, preferred,\nor laid before the Tribunal, shall henceforth be considered and treated as finally\nsettled, barred, and inadmissible.\nIn Testimony whereof this present Decision and Award has been made in\nduplicate, and signed by the Arbitrators who have given their assent thereto,\nthe whole being in exact conformity with the provisions of Article VH. of the\nsaid Treaty of Washington.\nMade and concluded at the Hotel de Ville of Geneva, in Switzerland, the\n14th day of the month of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\nhundred and seventy-two.\n(Signed)\n(Signed)\n(Signed)\n(Signed)\nC.

Previously it had been traversed and partially\noccupied only by the Fur-traders, first of the North-West,\nand afterwards of the Hudson's Bay, Companies; by whom\nits various divisions were distinguished by different names,\nmost of which are still retained for local designation. The\nadjacent Island of Vancouver, separated from the mainland\nby a narrow channel, in its narrowest part scarcely exceeding\na few thousand yards, had been partially colonized some\nyears before; and it might have been reasonably supposed\nthat these two adjacent and almost contiguous lands, with\ninterests so closely united, would have been incorporated\nunder one Government. But the wisdom of Downing Street\nwilled it otherwise. Established as separate Colonies, each\nenjoyed for some years the honor of paying its own highly-\nsalaried Governor, under the Imperial auspices; with the\ndignity of enacting its own special laws, not always in strict\nobservance of the interests of its neighbour. Of course this\ncould not last; and in 1866 the common-sense of the two\nColonies, though reluctantly elicited, brought about a union.\nSubsequently, on the 20th July, 1871, the united Colony\nbecame confederated as a Province of the Dominion of\nCanada.\nIt is as a sequel to this last-named event, and in view of\nthe rapid advance of the most important interests of the\ncountry under its new connexion, that the Provincial Government has judged it expedient to invite the production of \n2    boundaries, and general geography.\nsuch information as may meet the enquiries of the industrious\nsettler whose views tend hitherward. It will, then, be the\nobject of the following treatise to present, in a brief and\ncompendious form, such general account of the country and\nits resources as may seem appropriate to the end in view.\nThe limits of the Province may be thus broadly indicated.\nCo-terminous on the South with the United States Territory\nof Washington, the 49th Parallel of North Latitude forms\nthe boundary from the Gulf of Georgia to the summit of the\nRocky Mountains, which it intersects in Longitude 114\u00b0 West,\nthere touching on the Dominion territory of the North-West.\nThence along the summit of the Pocky Mountains to the\nparallel of Mount St. Elias, in about Latitude 62\u00b0. Thence\nSouthward as far as 54\u00b0 40', along the strip of coast-line, ten\nmarine leagues in width, formerly occupied by Russia, recently purchased by the United States, and now forming\npart of the Territory of Alaska. Thence Southward to the\nentrance of the Strait of Fuca, including Queen Charlotte\nand Vancouver Island, and the vast archipelago connected\ntherewith.\nThe three principal streams of British Columbia are, the\nColumbia, the Fraser, and the Peace. The last-mentioned,\nrising in the angle formed by the Peak Range with the\nRocky Mountains and the Coast Range, after receiving the\nimportant gold-bearing tributary, Findlay's Branch, breaks\nthrough the main line of the Rocky Mountains, and, passing\nonwards, joins the great River Mackenzie : the united flood,\nafter a course of some two thousand miles, eventually falling\ninto the Frozen Ocean.\nThe Columbia, rising in the Rocky Mountains, pursues a\nSoutherly course, and, after receiving several important\ntributaries, and feeding the two extensive sheets of water\ncalled the Arrow Lakes, enters the United States Territory\nin Latitude 49\u00b0 j and after a course of nearly a thousand\nmiles, falls into the Pacific in Latitude 46\u00b0 20'.\n**I~ BOUNDARIES, and general geography.\nFraser River, comparatively the smallest, but in its relation to the Province by far the most important, flows entirely\nthrough British Columbia, entering the Gulf of Georgia a\nfew miles North of the Boundary Line of 49\u00b0, and in about\n122\u00b0 40' West Longitude; its course throughout being\nnearly parallel with that of the Columbia. The main, or\ncentral, branch takes its rise in the Rocky Mountains in\nLat. 53\u00b0 45\" N., Long. 118 W., there heading with the\nRiviere de Miette. a tributary of the Athabasca, which afterwards unites with Peace River in its course towards the\nFrozen Ocean. Fraser River was first discovered by Sir\nAlexander Mackenzie of the North-West Company, who,\ndesignating it as the Td-cout-che Tesse, or River of the\nTacully nation, descended it for some distance on his way to\nthe Western Coast in 1793. Afterwards, in 1808, it was\nnavigated to its mouth by Mr. Simon Fraser and Mr. John\nStuart of the North-West Company; from the former of\nwhom it has its present name. Fraser River, a few miles\nfrom its. source, flows into a lake some miles in length called\nCow-dung Lake, below which, considerably increased by a\ntributary from the north, it enters Moose Lake, a beautiful\nsheet of water some nine miles in length. Thence the river\ncontinues rapidly to Tlte Jaune's Cache, being joined midway\nby a second feeder, likewise from the North.\nTete Jaune's Cache,* distant about 70 miles from the\nsummit of the Rocky Mountains and 730 from the sea, is\nthe limit of canoe navigation on the Fraser. About three\nmiles lower down, the stream is joined by the Cranberry\nFork, a tributary flowing from the South, which heads in\nwith the North Branch of the Thompson, to be presently\nnoticed, and the Canoe Fork of the Columbia.\nBetween T\u00a7te Jaune's Cache and Thle-et-leh, where there\nis a post of the Hudson's Bay Company called Fort George,\n* Named after an Iroquois trapper attached to the North-West\nCompany, who formerly frequented this neighbourhood\u2014called\nthe Tete Jaune from the lightness of his hair. 4 BOUNDARIES, AND GENERAL GEOGRAPHY.\nthe river is augmented by many tributaries; two of which,\nthe Mackenzie Fork and Bear River, are of considerable\nmagnitude. This point is in Lat. 53\u00b0 53', Long. 122\u00b0 45'.\nAn important branch here falls in from the Westward, proceeding from the Lakes of Stuart and Fraser. Quesnel's\nRiver, issuing from the great lake of the same name, flows\nin 100 miles lower down; and 40 miles below this is Fort\nAlexandria, seated on the right bank in Lat. 52\u00b0 33' 40\".\nIt is in the mountainous region comprised within the\ngreat bend which the Fraser makes between T\u00a3te Jaune's\nCache and this point, that the rich gold-deposits, known as\nthe Caribou mines, are situated.\nAt Lytton, about 180 miles from the sea, the Fraser is\njoined by Thompson's River,* a copious tributary flowing from the Eastward. This stream waters an important\nand extensive section of the country; its northern branch\nheading with the Cranberry Fork, before mentioned.\nYale, a small town at the head of steam-boat navigation\non the Lower Fraser, is 57 miles lower down; and New\nWestminster, the former capital of the mainland, some 95\nmiles below it. This last-named town, pleasantly situated on\nthe northern bank of the river, some fifteen miles above the\nentrance, and in Lat. 49\u00b0 12' 47\", Long. 122\u00b0 53', is, practically, the head of-ship-navigation on the Fraser.\nFor brevity's sake the names of the various extensive\nfeeders, falling in at intervals from Fort George downwards,\nare omitted. Of these the Chil-c6h, watering the fertile tract\noccupied by the Chilcotins, and entering on the right about\n60 miles below Alexandria, is one of the most conspicuous.\nThe Harrison, joining also from the right, is another. This\nstream flows by a short course from a picturesque and extensive lake; and was at one time the chief route of communication with the upper country; its continuation again striking\n\u2666 Named after the late David Thompson, Esquire, formerly Astronomer to the North-west Company. THE COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND, AC. 5\nthe Fraser some 40 miles above Lytton, at the beautiful\nvillage of Lillooett.\nIn order to a due apprehension of the geography of British\nColumbia it is necessary to indicate the ranges of mountains\nwhich divide its several portions.\nThe more Southerly part is separated from the Columbia\nwatershed by the Cascade Range, so called from the rapids\nof the Cascades upon the Lower Columbia; the point where\nthat river bursts through the chain. This range may be considered as a continuation of the Sierra Nevada of California,\nand it vanishes at the junction of Thompson's River with\nthe Fraser.*\nThe Coast Range (i. e. the chain of mountains lying between the interior of the Province and the sea-board) commences above New Westminster, and extends, parallel with\nthe coast, as far as Mount St. Elias at the northern extremity.\nCHAPTER II.\nThe Coast, Vancouver Island, &g.\nHaving traced the main artery of the Province from its\norigin to the sea, we may now proceed to notice the Coast\nregion, with its insular appendages, and chiefly the important\nisland of Vancouver.\nA reference to the map will show that the North-West\n*The designation \"Cascade Kange \" has been applied by the\nOfficers of the Royal Engineers, and some others, to the whole\nsystem of mountains in British Columbia except the Rocky Mountains. The writer thinks, however, that on reconsideration these\ngentlemen will agree with him in the classification he has always\nadvocated, not only as calculated to avoid confusion, but as being\ngeographically accurate. mm\n6\nTHE COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND, AC.\nCoast, from San Francisco upwards as far as the Strait of\nFuca, presents a line remarkably free from indentation.\nThence northward, however, the coast is broken up into a\nperfect maze of inlets, forming in their ramifications countless islands of greater or less extent. The minute exploration of this extraordinary archipelago by Vancouver, in the\nyears 1791-93, has given us maps the accuracy of which\nunder the circumstances has excited the admiration of succeeding \"navigators. Outside of the archipelago lie two\nprincipal islands, Vancouver and Queen Charlotte, divided\nfrom each other by a broad sound, and extending from the\nStrait of Fuca on the South to the frontier of Alaska on the\nNorth. The southern island, named by the explorer Quadra\nand Vancouver's Island, after the Spanish Commander then\non the station and himself, formed originally, with its dependencies, the Colony of Vancouver Island. It extends in\na north-western direction from Lat. 48\u00b0 207 to Lat. 51\u00b0, in '\nlength nearly 250 geographical miles; its greatest breadth,\nopposite to Nootka, being about seventy. Victoria, the seat\nof Government and Capital of the Province, is situated near\nthe south-eastern extremity of the island, where the adjoining Strait of Fuca is about seventeen miles in breadth. This\nstrait, extending into the United States territory by the inlet\nterminating in Puget Sound on the south, expands northward\ninto the Gulf of Georgia, which extends to Lat. 60\u00b0. This\nportion of the dividing channel in no part exceeds 20 miles\nin width; contracting afterwards into Johnstone's Strait,\nwhich, at the narrowest part, does not exceed two miles.\nBefore recurring to the consideration of the mainland of\nBritish Columbia, or entering on the topics which apply\nequally to both divisions, it may he well to note some particulars respecting the older portion of the Province. Victoria, its capital town and chief sea-port, above casually alluded\nto, is in Lat. 48\u00b0 25' 20\" N., Long. 123\u00b0 22* 24\" W., distant\nabout 70 miles, or six hours' steamer travel, from New\nWestminster on the Fraser : three hours from Port Towns-\ntIM. * THE COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND, &C. 7\nend, the Port of Entry for Puget Sound in Washington\nTerritory; and about 750 geographical miles, or from three\nto four days' voyage of steamer, from San Francisco in California. The position of this rising city, both as a distributing point for the Province at large, and as a nucleus for\nforeign trade, is thus extremely favorable: and the fact of\nits being the first available sea-port north of San Francisco\nconfers on it additional importance. The town itself is seated\non the narrow inlet of Camosae, which, completely landlocked, gives accommodation to all vessels whose draught of\nwater does not exceed eighteen feet. Larger vessels discharge\nat Esquimalt, three miles distant; an extensive harbour\ncapable of receiving vessels of the largest class, and destined,\napparently, to be, in connexion with the projected Railway\nacross the Continent, the future entrep6t of a national commerce, the extent of which it is not easy to foresee. Esquimalt is the station of Her Majesty's ships on this portion of\nthe Coast. Here are the naval yard, the hospital, and other\nnecessary appendages for the requirements of the squadron.\nA graving dock is in contemplation, capable of admitting\nships of the largest class, tenders for the construction of\nwhich have been invited by the Provincial Government: and\nevery thing indicates improvement of a permanent and substantial character. An excellent macadamized road connects\nthe two harbours.\nThe situation of Victoria is very beautiful, and the town\nboasts of some good streets, with fine drives, over excellent\nroads, in various directions. Adjoining the town a large\nextent of ground has fortunately been reserved for a public\npark. This picturesque locality, known as Beacon Hill, borders on the Straits; and on the opposite shore tower in\ngrand outline the snow-clad summits of the Olympian Range.\nHere is the public race course; and here the cricket-matches\nare played; when the fleet against the towns-men, or the\nmarried men against the single, compete for honors. On the\noutskirts of the town are many attractive residences: and HP\n8\nTHE COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND, AC.\nevery cottage displays its pretty garden, cultivated frequently\nwith no small degree of horticultural taste. Though Victoria\ncan so far boast of no edifice of high architectural pretension,\nthere are many neat and substantially-constructed buildings.\nAmong these, though in rather florid taste, may be mentioned the Provincial Offices on James' Bay. We may also\nmention the Presbyterian, Wesleyan, and Roman Catholic\nChurches; the iron church of St. John, a donation to the\n1 Episcopalian congregation of the Province from that excellent\nlady, the Baroness Coutts; the Angela College for young\n| ladies, likewise originating in the beneficence of the same\nlady; the St. Anne's Convent, and Orphan School; the\nlarge hall occupied by the Mechanics' Institute; the Bank\nof British North America; the St. Nicholas Hotel; the\nAlhambra; and the fine hotel recently completed, called the\nDriard House. Various public buildings, to be built by the\nDominion Government, will shortly be erected; and the'\nEpiscopalian Cathedral of Christ Church, occupying the conspicuous site of the former building destroyed by fire, is in\nprogress. Some of these projected buildings, it is to be presumed, will be of a higher order of architecture than the\nmajority of those hitherto constructed.\nAbout seventy miles from Victoria, on the eastern, or\ninner, shore of the island, is Nanaimo, a small town of local\nimportance, originally established in connexion with the coalmines wrought in that vicinity, and around which other interests have sprung up. Among these may be mentioned the\nquarrying and exportation of stone for architectural purposes.\nThere is a deficiency of good stone along the coast, until this\nvicinity is reached: consequently the United States Government, when recently about to construct a Mint in San Francisco, contracted to get the material from Newcastle Island,\nnear Nanaimo. This contract, the stone having been hewn\nbefore shipment, is now nearly completed, and will probably\nbe followed by others of a similar description. Nanaimo is\na thriving little town, and, having substantial resources of THE COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND, &C.\n9\na permanent character, will doubtless continue to flourish.\nComox, some forty miles higher up on the same shore, is\nan agricultural settlement, prosperous and contented. It is\nsituated at the mouth of a stream of the same name,* and\npossesses a very productive soil. There are said to be great\nindications of coal here, and elsewhere in the vicinity.\nCowitchan, situated between Nanaimo and Victoria, upon\na river of the same name, is a flourishing agricultural settlement. In the same district are Chemainis, and Salt-spring\n(or Admiralty) Island; also agricultural and pastoral in their\ncharacter.\nVictoria District occupies the peninsula, at the base of\nwhich is the town of Victoria. It embraces many fine and\nvaluable farms, and includes the settlements of Lake and\nSaanich. The latter, especially, forming the extremity of the\npeninsula, is a fertile and beautiful tract.\nPassing Esquimalt westward, along the Strait of Fuca, are\nthe settlements of Metchosin and Sooke, of an agricultural\nand pastoral character. Near Sooke are gold-diggings, which,\nthough not excitingly attractive, give earnest of something\nbetter, and meanwhile yield a moderate income to the few\nwho occupy themselves in the quest.\nUpon the Outer or Western Coast there are at present no\nagricultural settlements; the business prosecuted there being\nonly the traffic with the natives for oil and furs. In Alberni\nInlet, Barclay Sound, are extensive saw-mills, erected at large\noutlay by an English firm; but they are not at present in\noperation. At the northern end are the Saw-quash coalmines ; but they are only partially wrought for the casual\nsupply of passing steamers, and cannot, it is to be presumed,\nbe brought into competition with those in the more accessible position of Nanaimo. Fort Rupert, a post of the Hudson's Bay Company, is in this neighbourhood.\nIt is not, however, the intention to enter into minute local\nparticulars; but rather to indicate broadly the general features of the country, and afterwards to refer to special points\n* Sometimes called the Courtenay Jtiver. ^-ftJi'^M \u2022 ^Sf^\n10\nTHE COAST, VANCOUVER ISLAND, AC.\nwhen-necessary. While the coast-line of Vancouver Island\nis well known, the interior has been very partially explored.\nA mountainous ridge appears to traverse it lengthwise, in\nwhich are certain depressions occupied by extensive lakes;\nand it is probable that much agricultural and pastoral country remains yet to be developed. So far the portions that\nhave been taken up along the inner sea-board are found to\nbe extremely fertile and easily brought into cultivation.\nLittle necessity for clearing, save partially in spots, has yet\nexisted; but, the more open grounds being first occupied,\nthe use of the axe will become constantly more necessary in\nthis division of the Province Within the limits of the\nmountains rich mineral deposits are known to exist. Coal is\nfound in several po.-itions, and timber of the finest quality\noccupies the forest tracts. But on these and other points\nmore will be said hereafter.\nQueen Charlotte's Island, considerably smaller than Vancouver Island, is generally of a mountainous character, its\nshores presenting, however, spots well adapted for the cultivation of the potato and other vegetables. But it is as a\nmineral region that this island has chiefly to be considered;\nand as such it will, it is believed, eventually prove extremely\nvaluable. Gold-bearing quartz of very rich quality was extracted at a point called Mitchell's Harbour, as far back as\n1852; but for various reasons the quest of this metal has\nnever been vigorously prosecuted in this locality. Copper\nand other ores exist; and a fine vein of anthracite coal, said\nto be of a superior quality, has been partially wrought, but\nthe working is at present suspended. Want of capital is\nalleged to be the cause why this last enterprise has not been\nprosecuted to a more successful issue.\nFort Simpson, a post belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, is situated near the entrance of Observatory Inlet, close\nby the southern frontier of Alaska. Methlakathla, a missionary settlement under the supervision of the Reverend Mr.\nDuncan of the Church Missionary Society, is situated some GEOGRAPHICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF MAINLAND.\n11\n30 miles to the southward of it, at a point known formerly\nto navigators as Pearl Harbour. Near this, at the entrance\nof the Skeena River is Port Essington, in Lat. 54\u00b0 15'; a\nnewly established settlement, to which further allusion will\nbe made, with reference to the recent gold-discoveries on\nPeace River.\nA cursory reference to the map will show the almost numberless islands of all dimensions which compose the remainder of this extraordinary archipelago, and of whieh no special\nmention can of course be attempted. Many share, doubtless,\nto a greater or less extent the attributes of their larger outlying neighbours: and all participate in the facilities for\nsecuring the teeming products by which, as will be seen, the\nmaritime waters of the Province are notably distinguished.\nCHAPTER IH.\nGeographical Subdivisions of the Mainland.\u2014General Characteristics of each.\u2014Lines op Communication, &c.\nThe mainland of British Columbia, apart from the seaboard, may be divided into three sections, each differing from\nthe other in its attributes. The first extends from the mouth\nof Fraser River to the head of the Rapids above Yale : the\nsecond, from that point to Alexandria: the third, thence to\nthe Rocky Mountains.\nThe characteristics of the lower district are a surface\nthickly wooded in most parts with trees of enormous growth,\nchiefly varieties of the Fir and Pine, and intermixed with\nthe Red Cedar (Thuja Occidentalis of DoUglas, Gigantea of\nNuttall) and the Maple-plane (Platanus Acerifolia). Low\nalluvial points fringe these thickets.    These, as well as the 12\ngeographical subdivisions of mainland.\nI\n:  f\nnumerous islets along the river, are covered with Aspens,\nBalsam Poplars, and Alders, of luxuriant growth. In the\nlower part are some extensive meadows, yielding, in their\nnatural state, heavy crops of a coarse but nutritious grass,\nand, under cultivation, enormous returns of cereals and other\nproduce. For a certain period of the year mosquitoes are\ntroublesome along the river, as high, nearly, as Hope: but\nthere has never been manifested any symptom of fever and\nague, or other similar endemic, so often generated in positions of a like description.\nOn the verge of the second, or central, division a marked\nchange commences. The copious rains which fall in the\nlower district are greatly modified after we pass the mountainous ridge through which the river bursts near Vale.\nEvidences of a drier climate appear at every step. The\ncharacter of the vegetation changes. About Lyttdn the\nCactus begins to appear. In spots along the Thompson the\nArtemisia, and other shrubs indicative of a dry and hot climate, are found : and in lieu of the thickly-wooded luxuriance of the lower region, a succession of open valleys, covered with fine pasture and bordered by grassy hills in parts\nmore or less wooded, delights the eye of the traveller.' Here\nand there belts of forest intervene; amid which broad expanses of open land lie scattered at intervals. This general\ndescription may be regarded as applying to a very large tract\nof country, extending from Alexandria on the Fraser, in\nLatitude 52\u00b0 33', to the Southern Boundary Line on the\nOkinagan River: and thence at intervals towards the southeastern angle of the Province. Near the point just mentioned, where the Boundary Line intersects the Okinagan\nRiver flowing into the Columbia, the country begins to as-\"\nsume, in its general features, a very sterile character. An\narid sandy region, almost tropical in its temperature, replaces\nthe rich scenery through which we have been passing. Crossing the frontier into the United States Territory, as we\ndescend the Okinagan towards the Columbia, this character geographical subdivisions of mainland.\n18\nbecomes more general. The alluvial bottoms alone, where\nthere is natural irrigation, are susceptible of culture: the\nmain feature of the prospect is a torrid waste of sand, in\nwhich the Wormwood and other varieties of the Artemisia,\nthe Cactus, and other vegetation proper to similar wastes of\nremote volcanic and diluvial origin, alone find nutriment.\nWe have entered, in short, upon the North-western angle of\nthe Great American Desert : and hence, within the\nNevada range, to beyond the frontiers of Mexico, these vast\nu Sage Barrens \" lie extended before the traveller.* Let us\nrecede, however, from this uninviting field, and confine our\nview within the more attractive limits of our own favored\nProvince.\nThe third division of British Columbia, from Alexandria\nto the Mountains, varies materially from the other two. The\nagricultural region, properly so called, may be said to terminate in the vicinity of Alexandria; though there. are many\nsmall spots beyond that point which may be advantageously\ncultivated for culinary vegetables and the harder cereals.\nGenerally speaking it is a wooded country, through which\nmany open spots of excellent soil are interspersed, with large\ntracts of luxuriant pasture\u2014especially in the direction of\nFraser and Stuart Lakes, and in the Chilcotin country. From\nFort George, however, up the main branch of the Fraser to\nTete Jaune's Cache, none of these open places appear: and\nthough many cultivable patches along the river banks might\nin parts be readily cleared, it is probable that the occurrence\nof summer night-frosts would prevent the growth of any save\nthe hardier vegetables. Fraser Lake, however, and the\nneighbouring lake of Stuart, have been for many years the\nscene of agricultural operations on a small scale, at the Posts,\nformerly of the North-West, and since the coalition of 1821, of\n* The prevalence of the scented Artemisia (\"Sage\" of the\nAmerican trappers) upon the Southern Branch of the Columbia\nRiver, led the early Spanish colonists of Califoraia to call it the (\nRio del Oregano, or River of the Marjoram : hence the origin of\nthe term Oregon since applied to the whole territory. '33\u00a7fi&\n14\nGEOGRAPHICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF MAINLAND.\nthe Hudson's Bay Company. At the former place, especially,\nthese limited operations were invariably successful. Potatoes, turnips, and other vegetables throve wonderfully.\nBarley yielded invariably a heavy return; and though wheat\nwas cultivated occasionally only, on a very small scale, and\nrather experimentally than as a crop, it ripened well in favorable positions. The pasture in these vicinities is of the most\nluxuriant description, consisting of fine natural grasses intermixed with a nutritious kind of wild pea, or vetch. Cattle\nand horses of course thrive well; but the necessity of providing fodder against the lengthened winter of these elevated\nparts, discourages their being raised beyond a limited extent.\nThis upper region, however, is to be considered more\nespecially as the mining district: and any partial cultivation\nthat may be attempted to meet an extended market in connexion with the mines, must be regarded only as subsidiary\nto the main supply, derived from a remoter source.\nWe have deferred to notice the Lakes which are dispersed\nthroughout the interior of the Province, and which constitute one of its most charming characteristics\u2014for British\nColumbia is emphatically a Land of Lakes. It would be a\nvain attempt to describe the beauties of many of these\nsuperb sheets of water: and impossible to enumerate even a\ntithe of their number. In the aggregate there are many\nhundreds, varying in dimensions from seventy miles and\nupwards in length, by four or five miles in breadth, to the\nmere mountain tarn of a few acres in extent. Abounding\nwith fish, the water of these lakes is generally very pure. In\nsome, however, where the outfall is deficient, there is an alkaline taint, arising from the presence of the sulphate and other\ncombinations of soda. Of this condition Green Lake, situated\nbetween Alexandria and Thompson's River, is a notable example. About thirty miles in length, with a beautiful grassy\nshore, it has no outlet save very partially by underground\ndrainage in the direction of the Bonaparte, a tributary of the\n\u2022i&iite GEOGRAPHICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF MAINLAND.\n15\nThompson. It is consequently very strongly impregnated\nwith the accumulated salt; its colour being at the same time\na fine sea-green.* Of the principal Lakes the following\nmay be mentioned. On tributaries of the Fraser: Stuart's\nLake and Lake Tatla, Eraser's Lake, Lac des Frangais, Bear\nLake, Quesnel and Caribou Lake, Lake Chilcotin, Lac a la\nHache, Lakes Anderson and Seton, Harrison's Lake, Pitt\nLake, near New Westminster; the upper. and lower Shew-\nshwap Lakes on Thompson's River; Horse Lake and Lac des\nRochers on the North Branch. On the Columbia water-shed\nthe great Okinagan Lake and the Osooyoos; the Arrow Lakes;\nthe Great Lake of the Arcs-plattes on the Kootanais Branch.\nOn the waters of Peace River, McLeod's Lake &c. Close to\nStuart's Lake, and connected with it by a waggon road nine\nmiles in length passing over a depression in the Coast-range,\nis Nata-punkat, or Babine Lake, a sheet of water ol the first\nmagnitude heading a branch of the River Skeena: and on a\ntributary of the same stream flowing from the northward is\nConnolly's Lake; on both of which are posts of the Hudson's\nBay Company.\nIt will be enquired what facilities of communication exist\nby which the extremes of the vast tract of country composing\nthe interior of British Columbia are connected. Putting\naside the artificial roads that have of late years been constructed, and to which reference will presently be made, it\nmay be mentioned that from immemorial time a system of\nroads or rather trails, has existed throughout, which, originally\ntraced by the natives for mutual intercourse, served, until\nrecently, for all the purposes of communication and transport.\n*Oaptain R. M. Parsons of the Royal Engineers, in his report to\nColonel Moody, of the 16th September, 1862, says of this ana other\nsimilar Lakes \"I did not examine the water of these Lakes, but\nthey probably contain the same impurities as those met with when\n\u2666ravelling with you near Okinagan, viz: Sulphur, Carbonic Acid,\nSoda (as Sulphate of Soda or Sulphide of Sodium and Carbonate\nof Soda) and common Salt, probably derived from decomposing\ntrachyte in the soil.\" 16\nGEOGRAPHICAL SUBDIVISIONS OF MAINLAND.\nThese pack-trans\u2014for they were nothing more\u2014have since\nbeen improved, where necessary, so as to admit of the passage\nof wheeled vehicles along the principal lines. In some parts\nlong tracts required no improvement and were at once available for all the purposes of transport: and such natural roads,\nwith interruptions more or less frequent in parts, radiate\nthroughout the valleys, affording ready communication between various points with pack-animals, and improvable with\nmoderate outlay of labour into roads of a higher description.\nThe artificial improvements which have become necessary\nsince the colonization of the Country, in order to give access\nfrom the Lower District to the interior, are of the most imposing character; and have involved an outlay which, at the\noutset, bore hardly upon the resources of the Colony. The\nfirst road opened with this view, commenced in 1858, and for\nsome years affording the only available route of access, was\nfrom Douglas, at the head of steam-boat navigation on Harrison Lake, round by the Lakes Anderson and Seton, to Lillooett\non the Fraser, some 40 miles above Lytton at the Forks of\nThompson's River. This road, however, though all-important\nfor the time, and destined probably yet to become of renewed\nexpediency, was after a while superseded by that which is now\nthe main channel of communication. Commencing at Yale,\nthe head of steam-boat navigation on the Lower Fraser, this\nlast-mentioned road is continued clear up to Barkerville, in\nthe heart of the Caribou mining-region. The lower portion,\ncrossing the Fraser at Kequeloose 18 miles above Yale by a\nsuspension bridge, is conducted along the river through a most\ndifficult country to Lytton. Enormous engineering difficulties\nhave been overcome in this great work, completed under the\nsupervision of the Honorable Joseph W. Trutch, the present\nLieutenant-Governor of the Province. A second bridge, upon\npiles, crosses the Thompson some distance above Lytton, after\nwhich the difficulties were of minor importance.\nA third route, crossing directly over the Cascade Range in\nan Easterly direction to the beautiful valley of the Similkameen\nw&m\n%&rak NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014TIMBER, TREES, &C.\n17\non the Columbia watershed, leaves the Fraser twelve miles\nbelow Yale, at the pleasant village of Hope. This, though not\nopened of breadth sufficient for wheeled-vehicles, is valuable\nas a short route of transport with pack-animals, in the direction of Okinagan and the Kootanais mines.\nSince the discovery, two years ago, of the gold-diggings on\nthe heads of Peace River, called now the 1 Omineca \" mines,\nanother route has been opened from the northern coast. Leaving the village at Port Essington, to which I have before\npassingly alluded, the Skeena River is ascended by canoe to\nthe Bear-river Fork; thence by land-carriage and water by\nway of the Babine Lake and over a depression in the intervening Coast Range to Lake Tat-la on the Stuart Branch of\nthe Upper Fraser; and thence across the ridge of the Peak\nRange to the head waters of the Findlay Branch of Peace\nRiver, where the gold-deposits are in process of development.\nThis route has the advantage of shortness of land-transport,\nover the route to the same point by the way of Yale: but\neach appears to have its advocates, and the balance of. their\nrelative merits seems to be yet undecided. Leaving, however,\nthe subject of internal communication to be reverted to hereafter, we proceed to notice some of the natural productions of\nthe Province.\nCHAPTER IV.\nNatural Productions\u2014Timber, Trees, Ornamental\nShrubs, &c.\nThe forests of British Columbia are productive of an inexhaustible supply of timber of the most serviceable kind. Confining the description to very narrow limits the following\nvarieties may be mentioned:\u2014 sw*r\ni\n18 NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014TIMBER, TREES, &C.\nThe Oak, which is not found on the mainland,* grows\nabundantly on the southern parts of Vancouver Island, and\nthe islands adjacent. It is of the variety Q. Garry ana f and,\nthough nowise equal to the British Oak, affords a very tough\nand serviceable timber.\nThe Douglas Pine or Fir {A. Douglasii). The uses of this\ntree, which grows to a gigantic size, are chiefly for the manufacture of deals and scantling for building purposes, and also,\nlocally, for ship-building. It is peculiarly well adapted for\nmasts and spars, from its size, straightness, and tenacity.\nThere is a large and constantly increasing exportation of this\ntimber, from British Columbia, and the adjacent shores of\nWashington Territory, in the shape of sawn lumber and spars\nto various Ports in China and the Pacific, and in spars and\nmasts of the largest dimensions to Europe. The quality of the\nlumber procured in British Columbia, at Burrard's Inlet, a\nlittle north of the entrance of Fraser River, is esteemed of\nsuperior quality, and commands, we- believe, an extra price in\nSan Francisco.\nThe Weymouth Pine (P. StrobusJ\u2014tlae White Pine of\ncommerce. This valuable tree is common on the mountain-\nslopes between the Coast and the Lower Fraser, It is especially abundant in the upper part of Harrison's River, where\nit attains to a large size and is of unsurpassable beauty.\nThe Balsam Pine, yielding the \" Canada Balsam \" of the\ndruggist: a tree of vigorous growth and very ornamental, but\nthe timber of little value.\nThe Hemlock Fir (A. Canadensis). Common throughout\nthe Lower District and along the Coast. The bark valuable\nfor tanning; the wood valueless for outside purposes, but used\nsometimes for indoor finishing as a substitute for better wood.\n* This remark, as a rule, is strictly correct; but like all rules\nhas its exception. A few oaks of small size may be discovered\u2014\nor might have been discovered 20 years back\u2014on the eastern bank\nof the Rapids above Yale. They did not probably exceed a dozen\nin number ; and, unless they may have been considerately spared\nfor their rarity, it is questionable whether any now remain. NATURAL PRODUOTIONS-\n-TIMBER, TREES, &0,\n19\nThe Spruce Fir. Found in most localities throughout the\nProvince, up to the limits of the Rocky Mountains. An easily\nwrought and useful wood.   (A. Menziesii.}\nPinus Banksiana, a variety of the common Scotch Fir, is\nfound in dry sandy woodlands throughout the interior of\nBritish Columbia, and up to the summit of the Rocky Mountain passes. A useful and durable wood. Found also on\nVancouver Island; but more rarely, and of smaller size.\nThe Red Cedar (Thuja Occidentalis, or Gigantea). A\nmost useful tree, found throughout the Province, up to the\nheart of the Rocky Mountains, but especially abundant on the\nSea-board and in the Lower District, where it attains to an\nenormous size. The wood of this tree is especially valued for\nits extreme durability; and for this reason is now in demand\nin San Francisco for the purposes of the Southern Pacific Railroad, for ties. Of this wood the natives make their beautiful\ncanoes; the broad sheets of the bark they use frequently for\nroofing; and its fibres are woven into blankets.\nThe Cypress, or Yellow Cedar (Cupressus Thyoides), confined to the maritime precincts. The wood, of close texture and\napplicable to many useful purposes, is of very superior quality.\nThe tree is not, probably, found south of 49\u00b0, and extends\nalong the Coast into Alaska. The inner bark of this tree contains an essential oil, which communicates its odor, somewhat\nas of garlic, to the wood, the effect of which is to protect it, it\nis said, against the attacks of the Teredo. This quality of resistance, added to great durability, adapts it specially for submarine purposes, for which, imported from Alaska, it is now I\nbelieve highly valued in San Francisco. The cortical fibres,\nlike those of the last-mentioned, are spun, and woven into\nblankets, but of a finer texture.\nA variety of Yew (T. brevifolia) is found along the Coast,\nand on the Fraser as high as the head of the Yale Rapids. It\nis used by the natives for the manufacture of bows, and it is\napplicable to various useful purposes, but does not attain to\nthe size of the English Yew.    The Alder, useful for turning 20\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014TIMBER, TREES, &C.\nand carving, is widely distributed, and in the Coast vicinity\nattains to a great size. The Plane-maple (Platanus Acerifo-\nlid) is abundant in the Lower District and Vancouver Island,\nand of very vigorous growth. A useful and highly ornamental\ntree, yielding in early Spring a copious supply of sap, which,\nthough less rich in saccharine matter than that of the Canadian\nSugar-maple, gives a product not inferior in quality. The\nBalsam Poplar, or Cotton-wood, and the Aspen, growing\nabundantly along the Lower Fraser, are very generally distributed, nearly to the summit of the Rocky Mountain passes.\nFrom the Balsam Poplar, which attains to very considerable\ndimensions, excellent canoes are excavated by the Indians of\nthe interior, which have this advantage over those constructed\nof Cedar, that they do not split through exposure to the sun,\nand consequently do not demand the same assiduous care.\nBut these periguas are nowise comparable in form to the\nbeautiful canoes of the Coast, formed of the more delicate\nmaterial, and with a far higher degree of art. The Birch,\nwhich is the chief hard-wood of the interior, is comparatively\nrare in the Lower District and on Vancouver Island; but\nthroughout the Upper Fraser, up to the verge of the Rocky\nMountains, it is common, and attains in parts to a very considerable size. The bark of this tree was formerly employed\nat the interior posts for making canoes for transport; but boats\nwere afterwards substituted. The natives do not employ it,\nhowever, for that purpose, like those of the eastern Continent.\nThey construct their light hunting-canoes of single sheets\nstripped from the trunk of the Weymouth Pine, where procurable : elsewhere of the Spruce.\nPeculiar to a portion of the Central District is the Red\nPine (P. Ponderosa); a very beautiful tree, growing chiefly\nin gravelly opens, and attaining a large size. The timber ia\ngood, close-grained, and durable; but, as its name indicates,\ncomparatively heavy. It is found commonly as far north as\nthe upper ford of the Bonaparte; but its nearest approach to\nthe Coast Range, westward, is the head of Anderson Lake. NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014TIMBER, TREES, &C.\n21\nA variety of the Larch (i. Occidentalis) is found at various\npoints along the eastern portion of the Southern Boundary of\nthe Province. It grows to a large size, chiefly in cold moist\nbottoms; but, though a beautiful tree, its timber does not\nshare the character for durability ascribed to its Eastern congener. Some other varieties of Pine besides those that have\nbeen mentioned are found in the mountainous parts: but none\nof these being of marked utility it is needless to enumerate them.\nOf ornamental shrubs there is a considerable variety. Of\nthese a few only will be mentioned. A species of the Arbutus\n(A. LaurifoUaX which by the way it is wrong to class as a\nshrubf is found abundantly on the shores of Vancouver Island,\nand elsewhere in the southern part of the Coast Division.. It\ngrows to a considerable size, sometimes being found with\ntrunks eighteen inches or more in diameter. The Red-flowering Currant (R. Sanguinea) grows abundantly in the same\nlocalities. A species of the Juniper, attaining rather to the\ndignity of a tree, is likewise found in immediate proximity\nwith the sea-ahore. In the Cascade Range, behind the village\nof Hope, a fine Rhododendron (R. Ponticum F) ornaments the\nslopes in the neighbourhood of the height of land. The\nSyringa, or Mock-orange (Philadelphus MultiRord) sheds its\nfragrance through the woods of Vancouver Island, and is common on the mainland both east and west of the Cascade Range,\nand nearly to Thompson's River. A fine Spiraea, rather a\nlofty shrub) is found in the woodlands around Victoria and\nelsewhere, which, besides the elegance of its flowers, is noted\nfor producing probably the toughest known wood for ramrods.\nThe Holly-leaved Barberry (Malionia Aguifolid) is very\ngenerally diffused; and in addition to the beauty of its flowers,\nhas the merit of producing a fruit valuable for preserving.*\nUpon the summit of the Cascade Range, and elsewhere in corresponding positions, are thick beds of the Menziesia, white\nand red. This plant, strongly resembling in appearance the\nHeath of Europe, has frequently been mistaken for it: but it\n\u2022 Tlie roots of the Hahonia, yielding a rich yellow dye, and produced in largo\nquantities, will probably be found to have a commercial value.\nK\\: 22\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014TIMBER, TREES, &0.\nis, I believe, a well-established fact that no trup Heath has\nyet been found indigenous to any part of America.\nOf edible fruits there are many kinds. Of these perhaps the\nmost important is the Service-berry (Amelanchicr Raccmosa,\nor Canadensis ?) \u25a0 a white-flowering shrub yielding a fruit of\ngreat utility. Abundantly produced, and easily gathered, this\nfruit is dried in the sun, and forms an important addition to\nthe winter store of the natives, as well as of the European residents, by whom it is no less prized. This berry is very widely\ndistributed between this and Manitoba; and along the Saskatchewan the dried fruit enters largely into the composition of\nthe finer kinds of Pemican. Though the shrub grows freely\nabout Victoria the .fruit produced is there of indifferent quality.\nBetween Thompson's River and the Southern Boundary, and\nespecially along the valley of the Similkamcen, it attains its\nhighest degree of perfection. The Cluster or Choke-Cherry\nthrives in the same localities as the Service-berry, and is little\nless abundant. At first harsh and astringent to the palate,\nthis fruit when folly matured is sweet and well-flavoured.\nThe Sallal (Gualtheria Shallon) is a well-flavoured fruit,\nborne in bunches by a low evergreen shrub, the undergrowth\nof woods in the Coast neighbourhood only. Several varieties\nof Vaccinium, or Whortle-berry, some confined to the Const\nand its immediate confines, others very generally distributed,\nas high as the Rocky Mountains, are also found : besides the\nRaspberry of several kinds, including one identical in flavour\nand nowise inferior in quality to the cultivated varieties; the\nwild Strawberry ; and the Cranberry; all widely distributed,\nand the hut an article of considerable export from the Lower\nFraser to San Francisco, where the fruit is in great demand.\nOne might extend, however, indefinitely this hasty enumeration ; but it is time to turn to other objects. Let it suffice,\nthen, to say, in conclusion, that here in British Columbia\nNature has been profuse in her gifts; and thai while providing\nabundantly for the more solid wants of Man, she has not been NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\n23\nunmindful of those minor luxuries which to all are grateful.\nThe copious feast prepared by her hand throughout the wilderness, and the varied beauties of the innumerable flowers that\nbedeck the plains, are but the earnest of those luxurious additions to her bounty, which the taste and the industry of Man\nhave been introducing, and will continue to introduce.\nCHAPTER V.\nNatural Poduotions Continued\u2014Fish.\nAs may be surmised from the enormous coast-line, and the\ngreat extent of the inland waters, the Fish of British Columbia\nenter largely into the consideration of her resources. Of all\nthe varieties5 frequenting the inland waters, however, the\nSalmon is the most important: and, as it will require a longer\nnotice than the rest, we reserve it for the last. The varieties\nof Trout, in the next place, demand attention; and for want\nof more legitimate nomenclature, they will in most cases be\ndistinguished by the native names, adopting those of the Ta-\ncully of the Upper Fraser, to the writer the more familiar.\nThe Peet is a red-fleshed Trout, frequenting the larger\nlakes, such as Stuart's and Fraser's. It grows to a great size,\nfrequently exceeding 20 lbs. in weight, and in some positions,\nI have been assured, weighing as much as forty, though I have\nnever myself seen any nearly so large. They are usually\ncaught with hooks, baited with a small fish, during the season\nof open water. In early spring the natives catch them by\nmaking holes in the ice and roofing them over with pine-\nboughs so as to exclude the surface-light. In this way the\nfish, attracted by a lure, is readily detected and speared.*\n* This device, it may be noticed, is merely a modification of the\nNorwegian water-telescope; and shows how readily Man, in exigency, arrives through different processes at a common end. 24\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014PI8H.\nThe Shd-pai is another variety, equal in all respects to the\nlast; but differing in appearance, its skin being marked with\nfaint orange-colored spots, and the flesh having a yellowish\ntint.\nThe Peet-ydz, or Salmon-trout, resembling generally the\nordinary trout caught elsewhere. There are, however, several\nvarieties, differing in size and quality, as well as appearance,\naccording to their habitat.\nThe Talo-ydz (i. e. Little Salmon), is a peculiar variety of\nTrout, of excellent quality, confined to certain lakes of the\nUpper District, and found, I think, in the Great Okinagan\nLake\u2014a sheet of water abounding also in the larger species.\nIn addition to the hook and spear, weirs are employed to\ncapture the various descriptions of Trout as they enter the\nrivers from the lakes to spawn. The gill-net, too, set in favorable positions, is employed for the smaller varieties. The\nartificial fly and the spoon-bait, which the angler bene on sport\nwould employ, were of course unknown to the native fishermen, whose devices I have mentioned.\nThe White-fish (Coregonus Alba), by many esteemed the\nPrince of fresh-water fish, found generally throughout the\nnorthern continent, is common to most of the lakes in the\nupper part of British Columbia. It varies very much in size,\nand no less in quality, in different localities: a variation arising doubtless from the nature of their food. Thus the fish\nproduced in Fraser Lake, though no larger, are in quality far\nsuperior to those of the neighbouring lake of Stuart; while\nthose of the small lake of Yoka, in the depression of the Coast-\nrange between the latter lake and Babine, are superior to both.\nFar excelling these, again, are the fish caught in a small lake\nnear Jasper's House on the Athabasca, a little outside of the\nnorthern frontier of the Province. The White-fish of British\nColumbia probably average from two to three pounds only :\nelsewhere, in parts eastward of the Rocky Mountains, they\nare found much larger.\nThe Loche (Gallus Barbatula), called also the \" Fresh- NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014PISH.\n25\n\u2022water Cod,\" is found commonly in the lakes and rivers. The\nliyer, like that of the true Cod, is the sole, or chief, depository of its fat.    A fish on the whole of very little mark.\nThe Pike or Jack-fish, common on the East side of the\nRocky Mountains, is not found in the British Columbia\nwaters\u2014and, I need not add, is not regretted.\nThere are immense numbers of Carp of several varieties;\nThese, when they enter the streams from the lakes to spawn,\ncommencing in April, are caught by the natives with ingenious weirs, and sun-dried in vast quantities.\nThe Sturgeon of British Columbia (Acipenser transmonta-\nnus of Richardson) differs widely in all respects from the\ncommon Sturgeon of the Atlantic (J.. Sturio). This noble\nfish is common both to the Columbia and Fraser River; but\ndoes not by the former stream penetrate to the British Columbia frontier\u2014interrupted, apparently, by the Kettle Fall at\nColvile, near to which point some have been known to reach.\nThe fish appears in Fraser River in early Spring, following\nthe shoals of a certain small fish, called by the natives\nOola-han, as they resort to the lower parts to spawn. The\nWestern Sturgeon attains an enormous size: in the upper\nparts of Fraser River, about Stuart.s and Fraser's Lakes,\nhaving been caught weighing as much as seven or eight\nhundred pounds. These fish do not, there is reason to believe, always return to the sea; but, finding abundant food\nin the upper waters, continue to dwell and propagate there,\nfrequenting chiefly the neighbourhood of the two lakes mentioned, and probably other localities. Unlike the Salmon,\nwhich constantly deteriorate as they ascend, the Sturgeon conversely improve; and are invariably fatter when caught in\nthe upper waters, than in the vicinity of the sea. On the\nLower Fraser these fish are caught by the natives in a singular but very efficacious manner. A canoe, manned by two\npersons, one of whom acts merely to keep the light vessel in\nposition, is suffered to drift along the deepest channel. The\nfisherman, seated in the bow, is armed with a jointed staff 26\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\nwhich may be lengthened at pleasure, and to the end of\nwhich a barbed harpoon attached to a cord is loosely affixed.\nWith this he feels his way, keeping the point of his weapon\nconstantly within a short distance of the bottom. The fish,\nslowly swimming upwards, is detected by the touch j and,\ninstantly struck, is afterwards readily secured. In the Upper\nFraser the bait is chiefly employed; but in the larger eddies\nstrong nets are found very effective. At the effluence of\nLakes Stuart and Fraser, near which the Hudson's Bay\nCompany's posts are situated, long stake-nets are set during\nSpring and Summer, by means of which a fish is occasionally\ncaught, the more highly prized for its comparative rarity:\nfor while the Sturgeon grows to larger dimensions in these\nvicinities, it is very much rarer than in the lower parts of\nthe river.\nThe Salmon entering Fraser River are of several varieties,\nmaking their appearance successively at various periods from\nearly Spring till the end of Summer. As a general rule it\nmay be asserted that the earlier shoals are the stronger and\nricher fish. For clearness sake I shall confine my remarks\nchiefly to two priucipal varieties, called by the lower Indians'\nSaw-qudi and Surk-k&i, by the upper Indians Kase and\nTd-loj by which latter names I shall distinguish them. The\nfirst, equal in size and quality to tl\nlarge\nalmon of V.urope,\nenter the Fraser in May; the latter, a very much smaller\nand not so rich a fish, arriving a month or so later. In the\nlower part of the river the natives secure them in large\nquantities by means of drift-nets. Higher up scoop-nets are\nohiefly used, which are wrought from stages suspended from\nthe rocks bordering on rapid currents; and above Alexandria\nthe Tacullv tribe construct ingenious weirs for their capture.\nThe Kase, entering the river as before noted in May, are\ncaught at Alexandria in the beginning of July; though a\nshoal, resorting to a small tributary called the Nascoh, passes\nunward at an earlier date. The Td-lo, arriving at Alexandria later, never reach the neighbourhood of Stuart's or mL\nmJ*m\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\n27\nFraser's Lake before the first week in August; preceded\nshortly by the Kase.\nTo those conversant with the habits of the European\nSalmon it is superfluous to mention that each shoal as it\nascends strives perseveringly and with unerring instinct to\nreach, for its spawning-ground, the spot where itself was\ngenerated. The course of the Kase, apart from the minor\nshoals which may diverge to their native tributaries by the\nway, may thus be indicated from the Forks of Thle-et-leh\n(Fort George), upwards. A division of the grand shoal here\ntakes place; one detachnjent ascending the eastern, or Te\"te\nJaune, Branch, the remainder ascending the western, or\nStuart, Branch, as high as the point called the Forks of\nChinlac, 60 miles above Thle-et-leh. A further subdivision\nhere takes place; one portion continuing to ascend the\nStuart Branch, nearly to Stuart's Lake, which, however, they\ndo not enter. The other detachment ascends the Fraeer Lake\nBranch, turning off short of that lake, and continuing its\ncourse up the large tributary there falling in, called the\nNejavcoh, on which its spawning grounds are situated.\nThe Td-lo, its van-guard reaching Thle-et-leh in company\nwith the rear-guard of the Kase, do not enter the T6te Jaune\nBranch, but continue undeviatingly up to the Forks of\nChinlac before mentioned, where a separation takes place.\nOne detachment, continuing up the Stuart's Branch, passes\nthrough Stuart's Lake on its way towards Lake Tat-la: the\nother following up the other branch does not, like the Kase,\nenter the Neja-c6h, but passing on to Fraser Lake, continues\nthrough it, and pursues its route by the tributary stream\ntowards the Lac des Frangais, on the inner verge of the\nCoast Range, and opposite to the Southern heads of the Skeena,.\nThis process, actuated by an infallible instinct, goes on\nundeviatingly from year to year: and though at times there\nmay occur, from inscrutable causes, a partial failure of the\nsupply, the periods vary but little, and the regularity of the\nsystem is never interrupted. 28\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\nIn the Appendix will be inserted a brief notice of several\nother varieties of the Salmon resorting to Fraser River, some\nof which, diverging up the Thompson's Branch and other\ntributaries, do not ascend to the Upper Fraser: and I will\nnow advert to a peculiarity in their fate, which, strange as\nit may appear, distinguishes the majority from all other\nknown varieties of the genus. There seems to be no question that the shoals resorting to the smaller streams debouching upon the Coast return, after performing their procreative.\nfunctions, to the sea, as elsewhere. Indeed I am disposed\nto think that those varieties which resort to the smaller tributaries of the Lower Fraser and the Columbia, probably\nfulfil their course in like manner. But as regards the main\nbody, resorting to the jdistant head-waters of those great\nrivers, it may be incontestably asserted that they never return-\nto the sea. At first incredulous of this asserted fact, subversive of all my preconceptions on the subject, it was only after\nthe observation of years, under circumstances which seem to\npreclude the possibility of error, that I was constrained to\narrive at the same conclusion. Without prolonging my notes\nby entering on the particulars of these observations, I may\nconfidently repeat the assertion that, the function of spawning over, the fish, still struggling upwards, die of exhaustion.\nUpon the main, or Eastern, branch of the Fraser, which as\nI have said is frequented only by the large variety or Kase,\nthe strongest of those fish attain as high as Tete Jaune's\nCache, between 700 and 800 miles from the sea: there their\nfurther progress is arrested by a steep fall. At the foot of\nthis fall, and elsewhere below, the stream swarms, in September, with dead and dying fish. The once brilliant Salmon, no longer recognisable save from its general form, may\nhere be seen, the function of spawning completed, almost\ntorpid from exhaustion j its nose in many instances worn to\nthe bone, its tail and fins in tatters, nay its very flesh in a\nstate of half-animated decay, either helplessly floating in the\neddies, or with momentary exertion still struggling to ascend. NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\n29\nIn no case is the smallest disposition to descend perceptible:\nits course is still onwards, until, dying at last, it floats with\nmyriads of others to be cast upon the beach, attracting to a\nhideous banquet a multitude of Bears and other carnivorous\nbeasts from the adjacent mountains. In like manner perish\nthe other shoals upon the head-waters of the several streams\nto which they resort.*\nI am not, however, to write a treatise on Natural History,\nbut to confine myself to such notes as may tend practically\nto a useful end. Nevertheless I may be pardoned if I have\ndwelt passingly upon a fact which, if for its singularity alone,\nis worthy of record. Before quitting this branch of the subject, too, I may supply some memoranda which will convey\nan idea of the productiveness, in-favorable years, of the\nsalmon-fisheries on the Fraser. At the Post of Fraser's\nLake, in 1836, 36,000 dried salmon were purchased and\nstored for use; and at other Posts proportionate quantities\nwere likewise secured out of the superabundant provision\nmade by the natives. The year in question, it is true, was\none of great abundance. At Fort Langley (some fifteen\nmiles above New Westminster) large quantities were formerly\nsalted every year by the Hudson's Bay Company, as well for\nhome consumption as for exportation. In some seasons between two and three thousand barrels were thus provided;\nthe fish procured by barter from the natives. For some years\npast private fisheries have been established, where large quantities are annually cured : and recently an establishment for\npreserving the fish in cans for exportation has been started,\nwhich promises to be very successful. The chief markets-\nare South America, the Sandwich Islands, and Australia.\nWe may here mention cursorily that, while the salmon, of\nsome particular variety, is common, perhaps, to every stream\nissuing along the Coast from the Coast-range of mountains,\n* On the Columbia the Salmon attain to the head of the McGil-\nlivray Fork, more than a thousand miles from the sea. There is\nthere a small lake, which, before the winter sets in, is crowded, I\nhave been assured, with the dead and dying fish. 30\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\nas well as to the many tributaries of the Fraser, it is not\nfound upon the waters of British Columbia tributary to the\nPeace River, or indeed to any of the streams flowing eastward from the Rocky-Mountain boundary of the Province.\nThus Peace River, and its co-tributary to the great McKenzie,\nthe Athabasca, as well as the Saskatchewan, are destitute of\nthis valuable fish. With our knowledge of the habits of the\ngenus it would be a facile undertaking to introduce the fish\nartificially into these rivers, by spawn taken from the western\nwatershed: but it is questionable whether the extreme length\nof the two first-named streams, at least, in their course to the\nocean, might not prove an insurmountable obstacle to their\nsuccessful propagation. Nevertheless, it is possible that the\nattempt may at some future day be made.\nA very valuable fish entering Fraser River to spawn in\nearly Spring, is the Thaleichthys (or preferably Osmerus)\nRichardsonii\u2014locally known as the Oola-han.* It appears\nin immense shoals, and is caught either with the scoop-net,\nor, like the Herring on the sea-board, with the rake. This\nsimple device is merely a long light pole, flattened in one\ndirection so as to pass readily through the water, and with\nthe edge set towards the lower extremity with a row of\nsharply-pointed teeth. The fisherman, entering the shoal,\npasses the implement repeatedly through the water, with a\nrapid stroke, each time transfixing several fish. Thus a copious\nsupply is soon secured. The Oolahan is, in the estimation\nof most people, one of the most delicious products of the*sea.\nSmaller than the Herring, it is of a far more delicate flavor;\nand so rich that, when dried, it is inflimmable.\"j\"    This fish\n* I was long under the impression that this fish was a variety of\nPilchard (Clupanodon Thrissa) peculiar to the Pacific; and am indebted to Dr. Robert Brown, of Edinburgh, formerly in command\nof the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition, for the correction\nadopted above.\nf So much so, indeed, that, in Alaska, where it is likewise found,\nit is I believe called the \" Candle-fish.\" It is mentioned by Fran-\nchere, in his account of the Columbia River, under the name of\nOulhe'lekane, from whioh its present designation is modified j and, NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\n31\nis not confined to Fraser River, but frequents likewise the\nNass, a large stream issuing on the frontier between British\nColumbia and Alaska; another stream debouching into\nGardner's Canal; and probably other rivers along the\nCoast. Those caught at the mouth of the Nass are of a\nquality even richer than those of Fraser River. The natives,\nwho assemble there in great numbers in Spring to prosecute\nthe fishery, besides drying them in large quantities, extract\nfrom the surplus a fine oil, which is highly prized by them\nas a luxury, and forms a staple article of barter with the\ninterior tribes. This oil, of a whitish colour, and approaching to the consistence of thin lard, is regarded by those of\nthe Faculty who are acquainted with its properties^ as equally\nefficacious with the Cod-liver Oil so commonly prescribed :\nand it is said to have the great advantage of being far more\npalatable. With the exception of a few scores of casks salted\nannually for local sale, and a quantity prepared like the Red-\nherring, this fish has not yet, I believe, been systematically\ncured, or become an article of exportation. There can be no\nquestion, however, that, when more widely known and \"properly prepared, it will be the object of much extraneous\ndemand.\nAs already remarked, all the larger streams along the\nCoast abound with Salmon. The Skeena, before mentioned,\ndischarging at Port Essington, and the Bilwhoola, flowing\ninto the North Bentinck Arm of Milbank Sound, may be\nspecially noted; though equalled, doubtless, by many others.\nThe minor streams swarm during the season with a srnall\nvariety, known locally to the northward as the Squdg-gan;\ninferior in richness to the larger fish, and therefore not so\nfrom the circumstance of its being strung on cords by the natives\nto dry, was called by the voyageurs Poisson a la Brasse, or Fathom-\nfish. They were formerly very abundant in Spring on the Lower\nColumbia ; but suddenly, about the year 1835, they ceased to appear, and thence-forward up at least to 1858, none frequented the\nriver. I have been informed, however, that they have since reappeared, and that there is now a regular supply as formerly. 32\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\nwell adapted for salting, but nevertheless of excellent quality.\nI may here mention as a peculiar trait that the Salmon of\nthis Coast\u2014at least those ascending the larger rivers such as\nthe Columbia, the Fraser, and others\u2014unlike their European\ncongeners, do not rise to the artificial fly. In the inlets\naround Vancouver Island and elsewhere, while they remain\nin the sea, and at all seasons of the year, they are readily\ncaught by trolling. The natives employ generally a herring\nas the bait: but the spoon-bait is found by amateurs to be\nequally efficacious. It will be inferred that the fish occupy\ncontinuously the narrow waters, adjacent probably to the entrance of the streams of their nativity, until they finally reenter the rivers to spawn: and, admitting the apparently\nunquestionable fact that some varieties, at least, never return\nto the sea, it follows as a consequence that the whole term\nof their existence, from the time when the fry descend the\nrivers until their final return to spawn, whatever the interval\nmay be before they attain maturity, is passed in these retreats. The quality of the winter fish, caught in these\nlocalities in their full perfection, is incomparably fine. The\nsize varies, apparently, in different positions. In the Saanich\nArm, for instance, a little to the north of Victoria, the\nweight may. vary from fifteen to thirty pounds or more: but\nit was mentioned about a month ago (in March) in the\nBritish Colonist newspaper, that a fish caught with the bait\nin the outer harbour of Victoria had been brought to market,\nthe weight of which was fifty-five pounds. Fish of this size\nare* however, comparatively rare. Repeated examination\nleads me to the conclusion that the Herring is here the\nfavourite food of the Salmon. It is the most successful\nnatural bait; and I have almost invariably found one, and\nfrequently several,-of these fish, in the stomachs of ordinary-,\nsized .Salmon; but smelts, and occasionally prawns, are also\nfound. It may be added that, while the Salmon refuses the\nfly or any other bait after entering the fresh water, the\nclosest examination of the intestines of the ascending fish NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\nS3\ndoes not, as far as my experience goes, reveal upon what\nnutriment they then subsist. A mucous substance alone is\ndiscernible; and it must be inferred that minute infusoria,\nthe nature of which the microscope might probably detect,\nis at this period their sole source of nourishment.\nBut we have dwelt sufficiently on this theme, and must\nproceed to notice the other products in which these waters\nare notably prolific. And first of the Herring. This valuable fish resorts in prodigious numbers, at the spawing season\nin early Spring, to the bays and inlets of the Gulf of Georgia,\nand elsewhere generally along the Coast. The method by\nwhich the natives capture them at this season, mentioned\nbefore while treating of the Oola-han, suggests an idea of\ntheir scarcely conceivable numbers. In appearance they do\nnot perceptibly differ from the European variety, though\nrather smaller. At the period in question the quality of\nthese fish is inferior j but when caught during their prime,\nwith the net, on the banks which they permanently frequent,\nthey are, to my conception, fully equal to their congeners of\nthe Atlantic sea-board. This remark applies at least to some\nof the localities bordering on the Gulf of Georgia j and I\nfancy is generally true. The spawn, attached to sea-weed, or\nto branches purposely sunk in the shallows for its reception,\nis gathered in large quantities by the natives, and dried for\nfood.\nThe Cod caught in the narrow waters are inferior to the\nAtlantic fish. There are, however, certain outlying banks\nupon which they are found abundantly, of a quality, it is said,\napproaching, if not fully equal to, the last.\nThe Halibut attains upon this Coast a very high degree of\nperfection. On the outer shore of Queen Charlotte's Island,\nespecially, it is found of a very large size; frequently exceeding 100 pounds in weight, and not unseldom, I am\nassured, of twice that size. Caught with the hook, these fish\nare dried in \"large quantities by the natives, especially of the\nmore northerly parts of the Coast. 34\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014FISH.\nTo these may be added the Smelt, the Rock-cod, the Flounder, Whiting, and a host of others, with which, in season, the\nmarkets of Victoria are constantly supplied\u2014chiefly through\nthe industry of Italian fishermen, who appear here to enjoy\na prescriptive monopoly of the trade. Oysters are very\nabundant. Those dredged near Victoria are of small size,\nbut well-flavoured : northward, in the vicinity of Comox, a\nlarger sample is procured. Of Cockles, Mussels, and other\nshell-fish there is a copious supply. Crabs and Prawns are\nnot wanting; but there are no Lobsters, save a small kind\nfound in fresh-water streamlets. Oil-producing fish, such as\nthe Ground-shark and the Dog-fish, are common to the whole\nCoast: the latter so abundant as to give lucrative employment to many fishermen and afford a boundless resource\nprospectively to others. Of the Phocidae the Hair-seal is\nthe most numerous; while the Fur-seal, the Sea-lion, &c,\nare found, chiefly on the outer shores.\nThe Whale-fishery has of late attracted much attention,\nand has been prosecuted with a certain degree of success;\nthough, from want of experience probably, less than one\nmight have been justified in expecting. On the outer Coast\nWhales of the largest description are numerous; which, by\nthe native inhabitants, who combine in parties for the purpose, are harpooned and captured by an ingenious process\nwhich it is unnecessary here to describe. In the inland\nwaters of the archipelago a variety known as the Humpbacked Whale is very numerous. These yield from 30 to 50\nbarrels, or more, of oil; and so far have been killed by the\nwhaling-parties with the harpoon-gun and shell. Many\nwounded victims, however, through some mismanagement of\ndetail, or perhaps unavoidably under the system, have thus\nescaped. The system, however, from its assumed wastefulness, is, I am informed, declared illegal by the general laws\nof the Dominion : in which case it will of course be interdicted, and give place to other schemes, less liable to objection. On the whole the pursuit of the Whale in these waters, *!<\u2022\n.\u2022w?\nNATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014BEASTS OF THE CHASE, &0. 35\nvigorously prosecuted, with a competent knowledge of the\nbusiness, will doubtless prove ere long a lucrative and extensive branch of the Provincial industries.\nCHAPTER VI.\nNatural Productions Continued. \u2014 Beasts of   the\nChase, Birds, &c.\nThe Beasts of the Chase found in British Columbia are\nsufficiently varied, and in parts very numerous. Of the fur-\nbearing kinds the following list comprises the chief exports\nof the Hudson's Bay Company, and recently of private\ntraders who have engaged in the business:\u2014\nBears, Brown, Black, and Grizzly;\nBeaver;\nBadgers;\nFoxes, Silver, Cross, and Red;\nFishers;\nMartens;\nMinks;\nLynxes, Grey and Spotted;\nMusquash;\nOtters, Sea and Land;\nPanthers;\nRaccoons;\nWolves, Black and Grey of the large kind;\nWolves of the smaller kind, known as the Cajote)\nWolverines.\nThe Black-tailed Deer is very numerous along the Coast,\nand on the islands from the Gulf of Georgia northwards,\nwhere they attain to great perfection in due season.    They S8     NATURAL PRODUCTION*?\u2014BEASTS OF THE OHASF, &0.\nare also common in the hilly parts of the Interior, as high,\nnearly, as Thle-et-leh (Fort George); above which point they\nare rarely, if ever, seen. Besides the gun, various devices\nare employed by the natives to capture them; along the\nCoast frequently by pit-falls, in the interior by the snare.\nThe large North-western Stag (C. Elaphus) is very numerous in the hilly parts of Vancouver Island, and upon the\nCoast of the Mainland as high as about Latitude 52\u00b0. This\nanimal differs considerably, both in size and appearance, from\nthe Red-deer of the Eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains;\nand though this difference may arise partly from the nature\nof its habitat, it is probable that they are specifically distinct.\nThey attain to an enormous size, approaching to that of a\nwell-grown ox; and being unwary animals are easily stalked.\nThis animal is locally called the \"Elk;\" of course erroneously, it being a true stag in all its characteristics.\nThe Rein-deer ( G. Tarandus), the Caribou * of the Canadian voyageurs, inhabits all the mountainous regions dependent on the Rocky Mountains and the Coast Range, north of\na certain point. In the interior this limit is about Latitude\n49\u00b0; in the Coast vicinage about 51\u00b0; south of which positions it is not found; or, if so, not far, and rarely. The\nspecies found in these localities, distinguished by Richardson\nas the Rocky-mountain Rein-deer, differs materially from the\nvariety common to Hudson's Bay, known as the Rein-deer\nof the Barren Lands, than which it is very much larger.\nThe general characteristics of this animal are so well known\nthat description would be superfluous. Its susceptibility to\nthe attacks of the fly, especially of the large Gad-fly called\nafter it (Estrus Tarandi, and the partiality it exhibits to\nthe odour of smoke, arising from its habit of resorting to the\n* It is from this animal that the famous Caribou mines receive\ntheir designation, from being situated in their ancient resorts,\ncalled by the Ta-cully, Hb-tsee-kaya, or Rein-deer region ; and\ntranslated to the miners in broken French as the Caribou-land. I\nhave seen this word written, with an affectation of the French\northography, Caribozuf; but it is probably not of French origin, but\nderived from some one of the native dialects of Canada. NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014BEASTS OF THE CHASE, &C. 37\nvicinity of casual fires in the woods as a protection against\nthe attacks of its tormentors, are taken advantage of by the\nTa-cully of the Upper Fraser, who, even in the winter season,\nemploy lighted brands of rotten wood to cover their approach\nto the herds while feeding.* During the Summer season,\nbesides other devices, the natives commonly employ the\nsnare for its capture.\nOf the three varieties of the Bear found in British Columbia, the Grizzly is the largest, and, as its distinctive designation ( U. Ferox) implies, by far the most formidable to the\nhunter. It does not climb, like the others. The Black and\nBrown varieties, only, are I believe found in Vancouver\nIsland. These are timid; and, with the exception of the\noccasional seizure of a stray pig of the settler, comparatively\nharmless. Dogs and the gun are an efficacious mode of hunting these animals: but the natives employ various devices\nto obtain them\u2014the Coast Indians frequently the dead-fall\ntrap, the Interior races the snare.\nThe Panther, or Couguar (F. Concolor of Lin.) of this\nCoast is an animal, formidable for its strength and rapacity,\nbut cowardly, save when wounded or at bay. Deer are its\nchief prey: but it occasionally commits a depredation on the\nsettler's stock. To encourage its destruction, a premium of\nten dollars a head is offered by the Provincial Government.\nIn the more settled districts these animals are becoming constantly more rare. They are found on Vancouver Island and\nalong the Coast for some distance northward of 49\u00b0 , but I\nhave never known them to be met with in the interior of the\nMainland, within the limits of the Province.\nThe Lynx (Loup-cervier, or Pichou of the voyageurs) is\nfound of two varieties : one, the Spotted, being common to\n* In the great mountain-plateau lying at the heads of the Chil-\ncotin River, and extending along the Coast Range, where the Reindeer are especially numerous, the hunters construct huts during\nthe fly-season, disguised outside with dead branches so as to resemble the head of a fallen tree. In these huts constant smoke is\nmaintained ; lured by which the deer approach, and are shot from\nthe ambush. mOUffi\n38    NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014BEASTS OF THE CHASE, &C.\nthe southern parts; the second, the Grey, confined, apparently, to the northern interior.    The latter, by far the finer\nvariety, appears periodically in vast numbers, simultaneously\nin British Columbia and in the regions east of the Rocky\nMountains.     These animals are caught usually with  the\nsnare; and when numerous afford a very lucrative employment to the hunter.    They prey chiefly upon a variety of\nHare (\u00a3. Variabilis, so called from its changing its color\nin winter from grey to white) which also periodically abounds\nthroughout the interior.    Increasing with marvellous rapidity, these last animals become for the time a very valuable\nsource of subsistence; and when the supply of Salmon partially fails in the upper parts of the Fraser, as it sometimes\nunaccountably does, the abundance of Hares supplies the\ndeficiency. When, however, the two fail simultaneously, the\nprivation is, by the natives, severely felt.   Reading not long\nsince an extract from some work professing to give an account of British Columbia, I noticed that a mysterious connexion is gravely asserted between the occasional scarcity of\nthe Salmon, and the periodical abundance of the Hare, as if\nthey were in some way mutually dependent: but it seems\nneedless to say that this extraordinary assertion is entirely\nfabulous.  As regards the sudden disappearance of the Hare,\nafter increasing to inconceivable numbers, I may add that it\nis caused by an eruptive epidemic, by which all are carried\noff save a scanty remnant through which the race is continued and its numbers propagated anew.  The Lynx disappears\nfrom a similar cause, generally the succeeding year; and the\nMarten, occupying the woodland tracts of the interior, is in\nlike manner subject to periodical fluctuation of numbers,\nthrough a similar process.\nIt would prolong unnecessarily this general account, were\nthe writer to dwell on the several devices employed to secure\nthe different fur-bearing animals that have been enumerated.\nBefore leaving the subject, however, we may notice divers\nother objects of the chase whioh, some of them of marked NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014BEASTS OF THE CHASE, &C. 89\nutility to \"the native inhabitants, present at least attractions for\nthe sportsman, if not important to the ordinary settler. Among\nthese the Mountain Goat is conspicuous, frequenting the precipitous eminences of the various mountain spurs, and especially numerous on the offsets of the Coast-range. Along the\nCoast the natives hunt it persistently, as well for its flesh,\nwhich, of the female at least, is sufficiently palatable, as for\nthe hair and wool, of which they manufacture blankets with\nmuch taste and ingenuity. Beneath the long hair of this\nanimal, which is of a dull white, there is a thick coating of\nwool, in fineness at least, if not in length, perhaps not inferior\nto that of the Cashmere Goat.\nThe Mountain Sheep, or Big-horn, frequents the less precipitous portions of the Rocky Mountains, where they subside\ninto grassy slopes. It is found on various ridges radiating\nfrom the main range towards the centre of the Province. This\nanimal, prized for the extreme delicacy of its flesh and the\nhigh condition to which it attains, is stalked as the herds\ndescend to the \u2022 lower grounds to feed\u2014the aid of a telescope\nbeing of advantage to detect their whereabout. As in most\npositions they can be approached very closely, loose shot is\npreferred by many hunters to the bullet, in the chase of these\nanimals: and this because, when not killed outright, the progress of the wounded animal is thereby sooner arrested. The\nwire-cartridge, however, is the most efficacious missile.\nThe Moose-deer, numerous in the vicinity of the Rocky\nMountains, is not found on the Coast, and does not penetrate\nfar into the central parts of British Columbia. A stray Moose\nis occasionally found as low down on the Fraser as Fort George;\nbut very rarely.\nAlong the verge of the Rocky Mountains the Wood-buffalo\nwas once numerous, and is still found at the heads of the\nMackenzie Fork of Fraser River and elsewhere, probably in\nlittle diminished numbers. From the heads of the Tlte Jaune\nBranch they had disappeared a good many years ago, and numerous relics attested the destruction to which the race had\nWPr, 40    NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014BEASTS OF THE CHA6E, &0.\nbeen' subjected. That portion of the Country, however, has\nnot of late years been so much frequented by the trappers as\nformerly, and it is possible that fresh herds may have appeared\nthere. The Wood-buffalo does not apparently differ, specifically, from the Bison of the Plains; but is said to attain generally a larger size, probably because less migratory in its\nhabits, and enjoying scenes of pasture less frequently disturbed.\nThe Birds of British Columbia are numerous in kind, and\namong them are many useful varieties which yield abundant\nattraction, not only to the professed sportsman, bent only on\namusement, but as a relaxation, at times, to the laborious\ncolonist, who finds in them a resource both of luxury and\neconomical utility. Among these the Ruffed Grouse (T. Um-\nbellus) is commonly found throughout the Province, frequenting chiefly the neighbourhood of water-courses and the adjacent\nforests. The Blue, or Dusky, Grouse (_T. Obscurus), a larger\nvariety frequenting the hilly tracts where Fir-trees abound, in\nVancouver Island and in the interior as high as the vicinity\nof Alexandria. The Spotted Grouse (2*. Canadensis\"). This\nvariety is very common in the wooded tracts of the Mainland\ninterior, up to the summits of the Rocky Mountain passes, and\nfrequents preferably the dry tracts occupied by the Banks'\nPine where the Uva Ursi and the dwarf Whortle-berry flourish. A bird of excessive simplicity; the male being probably\nthe most beautiful of the genus. The Sharp-tailed Grouse,\nor \"Pheasant\" (T. PhasianeUus)\u2014the Prairie Chicken of the\nUnited States frontier. Unlike the other varieties, which are\nfound chiefly in isolated coveys, these Grouse congregate in\nlarge packs, and are common to all the open valleys of the\nCentral District, up to a point a little beyond Alexandria.\nThey are in parts extremely abundant, and, frequenting the\nopen country, afford first-class shooting to the sportsman.\nThe Cock of the Plains (71 Urophasiaims of Wilson and\nBonaparte). This noble bird, approaching a small Turkey in\nsize, and known to the Americans as the \" Sage-hen,\" is never NATURAL PRODUCTIONS\u2014BEASTS OF THE CHASE, &0.    41\nfound except in the hot, sandy, barrens, among the Artemisia\nand the Cactus. I am therefore scarcely justified in classing\nit among the birds of British Columbia, saving that a stray\ncovey may occasionally penetrate within the frontier, at the\npoint on the Okinagari where, as before mentioned, the extreme North-west angle of the Great Desert partially intrudes.\nLower down the Okinagan they become extremely common;\nand after the subsidence of the summer freshets congregate in\nnumerous packs along the borders of the Columbia. This bird\nfeeds chiefly on the tender shoots of the Artemisia, the succulent leaves of the Cactus, and other products of the desert\nregions it inhabits; and it has this marked peculiarity, that the\ngizzard is much less compressed and muscular than usual with\ngallinaceous birds, is very large, and in appearance perfectly\nresembles a paunch or maw. This peculiarity has not escaped\nthe notice of Wilson and his fellow ornithologists. It has,\nhowever, in all other respects the characteristics of the true\nGrouse, and, like the rest of the genus, the legs and tarse\" are\nthickly feathered.\nThe Ptarmigan is found in all the mountainous tracts bordering on the Coast Range and the Rocky Mountains: probably, too, in the mountain-ridges of Vancouver Island. On the\nMainland I have killed it in winter on the elevated divide\nbetween the waters of Thompson's River, and the Fraser, in\nthe neighbourhood of the point known as Bridge Creek. In\nthe summer, before moulting, the snow-white plumage of this\nbeautiful bird becomes of a piebald hue.\nThe Crested\" Quail, though not indigenous, is becoming very\nnumerous in the settled districts of Vancouver Island. This\nbird, introduced originally from California, has thriven well,\nand promises soon to yield attractive game to the sportsman.\nOf Birds of Passage there is a great variety, including the\nCanada Goose, and several other varieties; the Mallard, the\nTeal, the Widgeon, and other Ducks; the Swan; and a host\nof others. Of these birds, in the Spring on their way upwardf\nand in the Autumn on their return from their breeding places,\nI, M\u00a5t wm'\n42\nCLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\nthere are immense numbers in every favorable locality. They\nbecome very fat, and are a valuable resource during their\nseason. \u2022 The delta of the Fraser is a noted wintering-ground\nfor these various fowl, where, over an area of great extent,\nthey are found in vast flocks. The Passenger Pigeon resorts\nto the Interior localities; on the Coast a different species, resembling the Stock-dove, is found. It is, however, needless\nto extend the list, which might be done almost indefinitely.\nOf singing birds there are comparatively few varieties; and\nnone equalling the songsters of the Old World. The Meadow\nLark may be instanced as perhaps the finest: but though its\nnotes are rich, they are not sustained. Beauty of plumage\nhowever, is a frequent characteristic; and prominent among\nthese is the Humming-bird, a variety of which is found\nthroughout the Province, as high even as Stuart's Lake.\nThere are several harmless varieties of Snake, but only one\nthat is venomous\u2014the Rattlesnake. This reptile, however,\nis confined to the dry region between Thompson's River\nand the Southern Boundary. Bad as its reputation is, the\nRattlesnake is after all an inoffensive creature, more sinned\nagainst than sinning. That its bite is very venomous, however, there can be no doubt: but in all the writer's experience,\nwhich is not a short one, he has never witnessed a case of\nbiting by this snake, even in parts south of the line, where\nthey are very numerous.\nCHAPTER VII.\nClimate, Agriculture, &o.\nBefore entering on the subject of the Climate of British\nColumbia it is necessary to remind the reader of the following\nimportant fact: namely, that the winter temperature of posi- CLIMATE, agriculture, &c.\n43\ntions on the northern Pacific Coast, as compared with others\non the Atlantic sea-board, is equivalent to at least ten degrees\nof Latitude in favor of the former. Thus the isothermal line\nof the mean annual temperature of 50\u00b0 Fahrenheit, which\nleaves the Atlantic in about Latitude 41\u00b0, and, curving into\nRuperts-land as high as the 50th parallel, is assumed to cross\nthe Rocky Mountains in about Latitude 49\u00b0, strikes the\nPacific near Milbank Sound, in about Latitude 52\u00b0. This is\nof course an approximation, only, as regards intermediate\npoints; but the extremes are marked too strongly to escape\neven the most casual notice. We are not, however, to enter\ninto a disquisition as to the possible causes of this disparity:\nit is enough to know that it exists; and that, for instance,\nwhile the winter temperature of Quebec is proverbially severe,\nthe corresponding season at the mouth of the Columbia, in the\nsame degree of Latitude, is as mild as that of the South of\nEngland.\nUpon the southern portion of Vancouver Island the climate,\nas a whole, may perhaps be compared with the last: saving\nthat there is a greater degree of summer heat, with less\nhumidity. The maximum temperature in the shade near\nVictoria, in parts of July and August, ranges from 80\u00b0 to 90\u00b0\nof Fahrenheit; and has on several occasions been remarked by\nthe writer as high even as 96\u00b0, carefully noted on an excellent\nthermometer, by Dollond, placed in the shade, out of the influence of reflected heat.* The mercury in winter sometimes\ndescends as low as 10\u00b0\u2014i. e. twenty-two degrees below the\nfreezing-point of Fahrenheit\u2014in seasons of extreme severity ;\nbut this very rarely, and for a very brief period. Hence,\nthough some winters may afford good skating around Victoria,\nand this occasionally for several weeks together, more generally\n* For instance, at 3 p.m. at a position in Saanich, in 1870\u2014\nJune 6th, 79\u00b0 July 6th, 94\u00b0\n7th, 87\u00b0 7th, 92\u00b0\n8th, 86\u00b0 8th, 83\u00b0\nJuly 3rd, 90\u00b0 9th, 86\u00b0\n4th, 93\u00b0 Aug. 2nd to 8th, 84\u00b0 to 96\u00b0 on 8th\n8th, 94\u00b0 9th, 93\u00b0\n1\n1\nH 44\nCLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\nthe ice will last only for a few days, or not become sufficiently\nstrong to bear.\nAt New Westminster on the Mainland, as elsewhere on the\nLower Fraser, there is a greater degree of humidity throughout the year, and the temperature, if more equably warm in\nsummer, does not probably attain to the same extreme of heat.\nIn winter, on the other hand, the lowest extreme, as might be\ninferred from its inland position, is comparatively more severe.\nIn the Upper Country the climate is dry, and continuously\nhot in summer; especially from the vicinity of Thompson s\nRiver towards the southern frontier, east of the Cascade\nRange. The same characteristics, however, apply in a somewhat less degree to the portion lying northward, towards\nAlexandria. Approaching the Okinagan, on the southern\nfrontier, the summer temperature is almost tropical in its\ncharacter. The winter cold, on the other hand, is comparatively sharp; but there is nothing approaching the continuous severity experienced on the eastern slopes of the Rocky\nMountains. Little snow falls on the general surface; and\nin many parts it is almost entirely absent for any lengthened\nperiod.\nIn the Upper District, beyond Alexandria, notwithstanding the elevation above the sea, the climate is warm in summer : in the higher localities, subject to occasional night-\nfrosts, But as a general rule these do not affect the lower\nlevels, where modifying influences exist. In winter, a\nmoderate degree of cold prevails; alternated occasionally\nwith severe intervals produced by winds from the northward\nand eastward mountains. Thus the thermometer will, during\nsuch intervals, sink to 15\u00b0 or 20\u00b0 below zero of Fahrenheit,\nand sometimes even to the freezing point of mercury. But\nsuch degree of cold is exceptional, and rarely lasts more than\nthree or four days at a time, when a genial change ensues.\nThis, briefly, comprises the main features of the climate of\nthe Province in its several divisions. For such as may desire\nto consult more accurate data, some nieteoroloeical tables K5H\nmm,\nm.'*m\nOLIMATB, AGRICULTURE, &C.\n45\nwill be inserted in the Appendix: meanwhile, in connexion\nwith the general subject, I subjoin brief extracts from the\npublished reports of Officers of the Royal Engineers.\nSpeaking of Fort Alexandria, Lieut. H. S. Palmer says:\n\"At 11 A.M. on the 16th August (1862) the temperature of\n\" the air in the shade being 70\u00b0 5 Fahrenheit, that of the\n\" Fraser was 58\u00b0 Fahrenheit; and at 10 A.M. on the 29th\n| of September, the temperatures of air and water were re-\n| spectively 58\u00b0 and 46\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\"\nWith reference to points in the vicinity of Alexandria he\nsays : \" The altitude of this district is frequently quoted as\n\" rendering it unsuitable to agriculture, but the highly satis-\n\" factory results obtained at Williams Lake and Beaver Lake,\n\" two of the most advanced farms in the Colony, where, at\n| an elevation of 2,100 and 2,200 feet, varieties of grain and\n\" vegetables are yearly raised in great perfection and abun-\n\" dance, indicate the fertility of the soil, and the absence of\n\"influences materially discouraging to agriculture. There\n\" are, in the section of country under discussion, large tracts\n\" of unoccupied land, where the soil rivals that of the farms\n\" above-mentioned, and where much of the ground is literally\nI fit for the plough.\"*\nOf the portion lying between Alexandria and Thompson's\nRiver, Captain Parsons writes: \" Bridge-Creek flows into a\n\"large stream which is said to be a tributary of Horse-fly\n\" Creek. Troughton's boiling-point thermometer shewed a\n\" temperature at the level of the house of 206\u00b0 0 on the\n\" 29th August, and of 206\u00b0 40 on 31st August, indicating\n\" altitudes of about 3,119 and 3,054 feet respectively, or a\n\" mean of 3,086 feet above the level of the sea; nevertheless\n\"the temperature of the air in the shade at 8 a.m. of the\n\" 29th was 57\u00b0, and of the water of the Creek 54\u00b0.

During six weeks, from the\n\"commencement of August, there were only two days on\n\" which rain fell, and then it was accompanied by heavy\n\" thunder and lightning.\" *\nEnough, however, has probably been said on this subject;\nand a brief review of the agricultural products of the various\nsections will serve equally to illustrate the capacity both of\nthe climate and the soil to second the industry of the agriculturist.\nIn the settled portions of Vancouver Island all the common cereals are produced abundantly. Wheat yields ordinarily from 30 to 40 bushels per acre %} Oats ~f produce frequently as high as 60 bushels. Indian Corn, though not\nlargely cultivated, and perhaps not an economical crop for\nthis locality, ripens freely by the end of September.    Pota-\n* Report of Captain R. M. Parsons, R. E., to Colonel Moody,\ndated 16th. September, 1862.\nf See Appendix Q.\nrV% 1 * a\nCLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &0.\n47\ntoes, turnips, and all the usual varieties of culinary vegetables, grow to a great size. The climate seems to be specially\nwell adapted for the growth of Hops. These are cultivated\nsufficiently to meet the local demand; the surplus, if any,\nbeing exported to San Francisco, where their superior quality\nsecures for them a ready sale.* The average yield is from\n1,200 lbs. in ordinary years, to 2,000 lbs. per acre in favorable seasons. On the peninsula near Victoria, and I presume in other choice localities, the Musk-melon and the\nWater-melon attain perfect maturity in the open air, without\nartificial aid; the Tomato and the Capsicum yield copiously;\nthe Peach ripens its fruit as a standard; and the Grape (of\nthe Isabella variety) produces abundantly and comes\nto full maturity in a favorable exposure. Orchard fruits,\nexclusive of the Peach which is not generally planted, are\ncultivated abundantly throughout the settlements, and with\nmarked success.\nOn the Lower Fraser the climate is adapted generally for\nthe same productions, and most of those enumerated are cultivated there.\nAbout Thompson's River the continuous summer heat is\nspecially favorable for the production of such fruits as the\nMelon. Indian Corn would probably be profitable as a general crop. Wheat and other cereals, with all kinds of culinary vegetables, flourish. In parts, where the nature of the\nlocality demands it, irrigation is resorted to with, as may be\nsupposed, the most successful results. Approaching the\nSouthern frontier, upon the Okinagan, the Grape, were it\ndesirable, might be largely cultivated, and, I do not hesitate\nto say, with success. I have already noticed the proximity\nof this portion of the Province to the Great Desert, the intense heats from which extend an influence far around.\nAt Alexandria, long before the general settlement of the\nProvince, Wheat was cultivated on a limited scale.f   From\n* See Appendix RR.\nf Wheat was also raised for some years in considerable quanti- CLIMATE, AGRICULTURB, &0.\n1843 to 1848, between 400 and 500 bushels were raised annually at the Hudson's Bay Company's Post, and converted\ninto flour by means of a mill, with stones eighteen inches in\ndiameter, wrought by horses. As much as forty bushels to\nthe acre, by careful measurement, and of the finest quality,\nwere raised on portions of the land cultivated during the interval mentioned. Of late years large quantities arc annually\nraised in the same neighbourhood, as well as elsewhere in\nthe Central District; and it is needless to add with the advantage of very different appliances for its subsequent manufacture.\nAs before casually remarked, the country from Alexandria\nupwards is to be regarded rather in the light of a hunting\nand mining region than as adapted for agricultural settlement. Nevertheless, as high as Fraser's Lake, Barley yields\nabundantly; and the Potatoe, with of course other culinary\nvegetables, comes to great perfection.* There are large\ntracts of the most nutritious pasture throughout.\nBefore quitting this important subject, however, I judge\nit well to pursue it a little further than I had at first intended. And first, preferring to quote, where possible, an independent authority, I avail myself of the following excellent\nremarks which I find published in the British Colonist newspaper, from the journal of Mr. James Riohardson, conducting the Geological Survey of the Province for the Dominion\nGovernment:\u2014\n\" The vegetable soil which has  been   mentioned seems\nto be of a very productive character, and whether in the\n\" forest, the field, or the garden, appears, combined with the\n\" favorable climate, to yield large returns. In the Com ox\n41 district, about 140 miles from Victoria, as already stated,\nties at Port George; bat owing to the occasional occurrence of\nnight-frosts, with varying success.\n* In 1839 the return, at Fraser's Lake, from IS bushels of cut\nseed, exceeded 700 bushels of Potatoes, of the Ladies' Finger variety. Manure, it should be added, was employed, and iho season\nwas verv favourable. CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\n49\n\" the soil is spread over a very considerable area of prairie\n\" country, commonly designated an opening, extending from\n\" the Coast up the different branches of the Courtenay River\n\" for seven or eight miles. The surface of this district, which\n\" is naturally free from timber, with the exception of single\n\" trees and stumps, chiefly of Oaks ( Quercus Garry ana) and\n\"strips of Alders {Alnus Oregond) in the bottoms, may be\n\" some twelve square miles, the scenery of which is pictur-\n\" esque and parklike. Its margin is very irregular in shape,\n\" and it is surrounded by a growth of very heavy timber,\n\" among which are the Douglas Pine (Abies Douglasii) often\n\" attaining ten feet in diameter and 200 feet in height, half\n' I of which is free from branches, and the Cedar (Thuja\n\" Gigantea), often equally large. The open country in its\n\" natural state is mostly covered with a growth of ferns,\n\" which sometimes attain a height of ten feet, with stems\n\" three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and roots descending\n\" to a depth of three feet. These roots the native Indians\n\" prepare in some peculiar way for winter food, and excavate\n\" deep trenches to obtain them. The farmers are under the\n\" necessity of grubbing up the fern roots before the ground\n\"is ready for use, and they are often voluntarily assisted by\n\" their pigs in this operation; these animals, it is said,\n\" relishing the fern root as food. I was informed by Mr.\n\" John Robb and Mr. John McFarlan, two partnership set-\n\" tiers of the district, that the average yield of land, after it\n\" is cleared and thoroughly under cultivation, is, of Wheat,\n\" from 30 to 35 bushels per acre; Barley, 40 to 45 bushels;\n\"Oats, 50 to 60; Pease, 40 to 45; Potatoes, 150 to 200;\n\"Turnips, 20 to 25 tons. Some of the Turnips exhibited by\n\" Mr. Robb at the agricultural show are said to have been\n\" remarkably heavy; but those of the Swedish and yellow\n\" varieties, seen by me, I consider rather small. The season,\n\" however, was said to be an unusually dry one. The yield\n\" of Timothy hay is said to be about two tons per acre.\n\" Clover thrives well, and rye grass is valued for its after crop.\ni~M&\" A\u00bbfc*UH\n50\nCLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &0.\n\" The yield of butter per cow, after calf feeding, is about\n150 lbs. annually, the ordinary selling price being 40 cents\nper pound. Cattle generally require to . home-fed from\nthe beginning of December to the middle of April. Snow\nseldom lies long. Heavy falls sometimes occur; but generally disappear in a few days. Once or twice snow has\nremained on the ground for two months. Apples, pears,\nplums, cherries, white and red raspberries, red, white, and\nblack currants, and most kinds of fruit, thrive remarkably\nwell. Some apples, of which I obtained samples measured\nthirteen inches in circumference and weighed nineteen ounces. They were high-flavoured and well-adapted\nfor eating and cooking. Of the pears many measured\neleven inches in circumference, and were high-flavoured\nand juicy.\n\"At Gabriola, prairie land, or openings, such as those\nalready described at Comox, occur. More of them are met\nwith on Saltspring Island, but in neither place of the same\nextent as at Comox. Mr. Griffith, one of the settlers at\nSaltspring, informed me that the fall wheat thrives well\nthere, and yields from 35 to 40 bushels per acre. Of other\ngrains the yield seems to be about the same as at Comox.\nIn Mr. Griffith's garden there was a large plot of common\nwinter cabbage, the solid heads of most of which measured\nfrom three to four feet in circumference. Red cabbage and\ncauliflowers were equally large and sound. Carrots and\nparsnips were large, as well as onions; and there was\nabundance of tomatoes, and several varieties of gooseberries, which did not seem to thrive so well at Comox.\nMr. Griffith informs me that at Saltspring the bushes give\nin quantity and quality a crop equal with the best English.\nThe crops of all the varieties of currants and raspberries in\n' quantity and quality vied with those of Comox.\n\" Mr. Griffith's orchard occupies about two acres, and has\n' been set out only three or four years. I saw different va-\n' rieties of apple pear, peach, plum, and cherry trees, and CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\n51\nthe proprietor informed me that all kinds bore fruit last\nyear. The apples are excellent in quality, and the pears,\nthough not large, were equal in flavour and juicyness to\nany I have ever tasted.\n\" Mr. Griffith has about 300 barn-door fowls, which are\nfed on the grain of the farm, and enable him to supply a\ngreat abundance of eggs to the Victoria and Nanaimo\nmarkets, where they sell from 25 to 40 cents per dozen.\n\" At Fulford Harbour, Mr. Theodore Frago shewed me a\npumpkin which measured 32 inches in length, with a\ndiameter of 15 inches at the small end and 22 inches at\nthe other; and he informed me that larger ones had been\nused before my arrival. The settlements of North and\nSouth Saanich, as well as of other districts near and around\nVictoria, show a good deal of prairie land,\" oak openings/'\nas they are called in that part of the country, from the\ngreater abundance of trees of this species than elsewhere. In\nthese oak openings many beautiful farms are met with, the\nsoil and aspect of them resembling those of Comox. In addition to the grain, fruit, and vegetables enumerated elsewhere, the hop vine has been introduced in North Saanich,\nand in the neighbourhood of Victoria. In the former place,\nMr. Isaac Cloake and Mr. Henry Wain, with some others,\nhave each a hop orchard, as it is there termed, of several\nacres in extent. Mr. Cloake, who spent nine years amongst\nthe hop fields of Kent, England, informs me that his hops\nare quite equal, if not superior, to the English, which, according to him, was tantamount to saying that they were\nthe best on the face of the earth; and Mr. Wain, who likewise had practical experience, stated that in regard to\naroma they were equal to the best he knew. They are of\nthe variety known as the grape hop. It was introduced\nfrom California, and is said to have greatly improved in\nBritish Columbia.\n\" The yield of hops, is here from 1,000 lbs. to 1,700 lbs.\n\" to the acre, and it brings in the Victoria market from 22\n'/**\u2022* 52\nCLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\n\"to 60 cents per pound. When Railway communication is\n\" established, the article may become one of trade between\n\" the two Provinces, for if I am rightly informed, the hops\n\" imported from England are superior to any raised in\n\" Canada.\n\" Other settlements of a similar character to those de-\n\" scribed are established between Saanich and Nanaimo,\n\" which I had no opportunity of visiting. Near and around\n\" settlements possessing farms such as mentioned, in many\n\" places rocky hills rise up to heights of 1,000, 2,000, and\n\" even 3,000 feet and more, the surface of which is in some\n\" parts craggy, but in others they present patches with a thin\n\" soil, covered with a firm short bunch-grass, on which sheep\n\" and cattle thrive well: for such of them as I saw were in\n\" good condition. The temperature is cooler in suoh places\n\" than in the lower and more level country, and during the\n\"heats of summer they afford excellent pasturage, which\n\" will much assist the industry of agriculturists. Along the\n\" coasts and in the interior of Vancouver Island, as well as\n\"on those of the archipelago surrounding it, many localities\n\" for farms, similar to those which have been here described,\n\" will be discovered, and hereafter become the homes of\n\" thousands of a hardy and industrious people.\"\nWith reference to the judicious remarks above quoted, I\nmay observe that the winter-feeding of cattle referred to by\nMr. Richardson does not imply the necessity of continuous\nstall-feeding, which of course with large herds, such as some\npossess, would be an impossibility. The under-growth of the\nadjacent forests affords, even during the severest season, copious and nutritious browsing. A supply of fodder at night,\nwith the shelter of commodious sheds, serves to maintain the\nmajority of the cattle in condition; while the milch-kine and\nyounger stock receive such additional care as they may require. By this winter-tendance a two-fold advantage, beyond\nthe mere welfare of the herds, is obtained: the straw and\nother offal of the farm are converted into manure for the future CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &0,\n53\nenrichment of the soil, and the cattle, knowing their homes,\ncontinue in all respects more tractable. The fern alluded to\nis characteristic of most of the open parts of Vancouver Island,\nand a portion of the Lower Fraser. The highest point at\nwhich it appears on the Mainland is at Spuzzum, a few miles\nabove Yale. The whole of the Central District is free from it.\nThough rather troublesome to eradicate entirely, it presents\nno serious impediment to the cultivation of the soil. By mowing in early summer\u2014affording, if stored, an excellent litter\nfor cattle\u2014its subsequent vigour is immediately checked. A\ndeep ploughing and cross-ploughing with a strong team prepares the soil for a first crop of pease or oats; but it takes\nsome years of cultivation before the last vestiges disappear. Swedish turnips, I may add, are generally cultivated, and in most\nparts attain to an enormous size; though, as mentioned by\nMr. Richardson, at times subject to partial failure, either from\nthe attacks of the fly, or long continued drought.\nThe comparatively humid climate of the Lower Fraser,\nadapts the vicinity specially for the successful culture of green\ncrops. With this advantage, operating on a soil of teeming\nfertility, enormous products are obtained. The dairy-yield,\npromoted by the copious and succulent natural herbage that\nabounds, is very great. At the mouth of the Fraser is an extensive delta, of which the soil, many feet in depth of pure\nalluvium, is productive in an.extraordinary degree. For instance, a few years ago, the newspapers took notice of a cauliflower, raised in this locality and brought over by one of the\nresidents of Victoria, the weight of which I am almost afraid\nto repeat. It was given, if my memory be correct, at twenty -\neight pounds; and certainly, whatever its exact weight may\nhave been, excited in Victoria general attention as a vegetable\ncuriosity. Portions, only, on the borders of this exuberant tract\nhave hitherto been pre-empted; and before the whole can be\nrendered available for occupation a system of dyking must be\nresorted to, to exclude the overflow of the summer freshets.\nThis process, I am informed, has already been entered upon, M2-\n*.x\u00a3*\n54\nCLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\non a small scale, by individual settlers: but a systematic prosecution of the work, whereby a wide expanse may at once be\nredeemed, is obviously necessary in an economic point of view.\nIn a speech at a public dinner recently given at New Westminster, I notice that the Premier of the Province alluded\nspecially to this important undertaking as having engaged the\nattention of the local Government. But there are obstacles to\nits immediate prosecution. By reference to the Terms of\nConfederation in the Appendix it will be perceived that,\nin connexion with the undetermined line of the projected\nRailway from Canada, it is provided that, for two years from\nthe date of union (July 1871) \" the Government of British\n\" Columbia shall not sell or alienate any further portions of\n\" the Public Lands of British Columbia in any other way than\n\"under right of pre-emption, requiring actual residence of the\n\" pre-emptor on the land claimed by him.\" Hence, until July\n1873, the Government is restrained from active measures in\nthis regard, either as a public work, or by charter to a private\ncompany who might be induced to undertake it. I am not\nprepared to state, even approximately, what amount of valuable land might thus be made available, as no actual surveys\nhave been made; but it may be safely set down at many\nthousands of acres, bordering on navigation, and with prolific\nsalmon-fisheries immediately adjacent.\nWith regard to the agriculture of the Central District there\nis perhaps little to add to what I have already stated. In connexion with the Upper District, however, I may make some\nremarks, applicable to it in common with other elevated portions of the vast Territory over which the Dominion Federation now extends. I have mentioned, as a drawback, in parts,\nthe occurrence of summer night-frosts, rendering precarious\nthe cultivation of the less hardy cereals, and vegetables of the\nmore tender growth. In qualification of this remark I may\nnow state, that by a choice of position this evil may be greatly\nobviated. It will be found that in many localities the low\nbottoms, too frequently selected for their apparently superior &M\u00bb*\u00ab\nCLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &0,\n55\nfertility, are subject to these frosts, while the slopes which\nborder them are entirely exempt. For this condition, without\nwishing to philosophize, a satisfactory reason may, I think, be\ngiven. The cold air, occasioned probably through rapid\nevaporation suddenly checked at night-fall, with its suspended\nvapour, descends to the lowest level, displacing the warmer\nand lighter superficial air below, which in turn ascends the\nacclivity. I do not question that a due regard to this natural\nlaw would, in many parts where summer frosts are found to\nprevail, save the farmer from frequent disappointment. The\nfertile bottoms, meanwhile, specially favorable for certain\nclasses of vegetation, should be'reserved for these: such as the\nturnip and other crops that are virtually frost-proof.*\nThe capacities for pasturage of the Central District are very\nextensive, and t)f a character unsurpassed, perhaps, in any part\nof the world. While the valleys, as shown, are fertile for the\nproduction of all the cereals and other produce in ordinary\ncultivation, the hills which bound them, extending on all sides\nin endless continuity, sparsely dotted with wood in parts, are\ncovered with herbage of the most nutritious description.\nAlong Thompson's River, and throughout the Southern por-\n*NotbP. S.\u2014Visiting the Hudson's Bay Company's post at\nEdmonton, on the Saskatchewan, at several times between the\nyears 1832 and 1842,1 heard constant complaints that the wheat\ncrops cultivated there were subject to blight from the cause referred to in the text. Subsequently, in 1849, when in command at\nPort Colvile on the Columbia, Mr. Rowand, the Chief Factor at\nEdmonton, wrote to me again complaining, and asking for a supply of seed-wheat to replace his own degenerated produce. I accordingly sent a few bushels across the Rocky Mountains by the\nAutumn Express ; and at the same time mentioned the result of\nmy own then recent experience at Alexandria. Whether owing to\nthis suggestion or not, I am not prepared to say, but a change in\nthe system of culture was subsequently adopted ; for Dr. Rae, to\nwhom I mentioned the subject in Victoria in 1864, partly doubtful\nof the adaptability of the Upper Saskatchewan for wheat-raising,\nassured me that, on his recent passage across the Continent, he\nhad witnessed, both at Edmonton and Lake St. Anne in the immediate vicinity, crops of the finest wheat, while flour of excellent\nquality was manufactured yearly.\nA1   W1    ft**    I*   l*l\u25a0 j*V\n^^^^F\n'                     < \u2022\u25a0--     r   \\   Vj*\"'         \u2022 \u25a0j^TQiz,   .   $\u00a3\"\"\u00ab \u2022- ',*    \u2022-'# \u2022'#'*\u2022 \u2122 .\nilP7\u00bb CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\ntions, there is a species of grass, called by the Voyageurs Fain\nRond, by the English settlers Bunch-grass, which is specially\nnoted for its valuable qualities.* The whole tract is well\nwatered\u2014in the intervals between the hills by frequent streamlets, in the level depressions by small lakes: while the groves\nand scattered trees afford a grateful. shade by day, at night a\nshelter. Under this conjunction of favorable circumstances it\nis not surprising that the herds of cattle, roaming at large in\nthe natural pastures, attain a condition approaching to that of\nstall-fed stock. Winter-feeding is in most parts quite unnecessary ; and it is found that the cattle in early spring, if short\nof their summer condition, are still in order for the butcher.\nThe Similkameen | beef, for example, when occasionally a\nherd is brought to Victoria, excites the attention of epicures\nby its excellent quality, and commands always the highest\nmarket-price.

He collected a\nquantity of the seed, with a view to its propagation in Europe;\nbut it is questionable whether it would thrive in any save the warm\ndry localities which are its natural habitat. It has the peculiarity\nthat it never ceases to grow : thus, however apparently dry the\nexterior, the heart, shrouded from view, is always green, even in\nthe depth of winter.\nPoor Jeffrey, it may be added, after wandering, sometimes in\ncompany with the writer, through a considerable portion of British\nColumbia, and braving all its fabulous dangers, met his fate in\nNew Mexico, in 1852. He was murdered by a Spanish outcast, for\nhis mules and his scanty travelling-appointments.\nj- Similk-ameen\u2014literally Salmon-river\u2014so named by the natives,\napparently on the principle of lucus a non lucendo; for no salmon\nnow frequent it. I am, however, disposed to think that in bygone\ntimes it was otherwise, and that the fall or rapid near the mouth,\nby which their ascent now appears to be prevented, has been not\nvery remotely occasioned through some convulsion of nature. The\nerection of fish-stairs at this point might, I think, be easily effected ; and, this done, the fish might be readily re-introduced : a boon\nto the settlers along the banks.

CLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\n57\nfound expedient to give occasional assistance to the cattle\nduring winter, when snow is on the ground, an. advantage is\nindirectly gained : the herds become more domestic in their\nhabits, and are gathered afterwards, when necessary, with less\ndifficulty. Horses, however, even during the severest winters,\nrequire no such aid. Unlike horned cattle, they instinctively\nscrape through the snow for a subsistence; and such is the\nnutritious quality of the herbage that they winter well. In\nthis way the large herd of horses, some two hundred in number, formerly maintained by the Hudson's Bay Company at\nAlexandria, were constantly kept in that vicinity : and the\nband at Kamloops, on Thompson's River, including broodmares and young stock, probably from five to six hundred, in\nlike manner shifted for themselves at all seasons.\nThere are probably now, grazing at large throughout the\nCentral District, under the circumstances I have mentioned, a\ngood many thousands of head of cattle, chiefly of superior\nbreeds. Of these a large proportion belong to permanent settlers ; the rest to graziers resorting thither from Washington\nTerritory and Oregon, as to a lucrative market, and for facile\nfeeding. The capacities of the Country are, however, so extensive, that the herds at present scattered through it have no\nappreciable effect upon its resources, beyond the comparatively\nlimited area of their feeding-grounds. It might be supposed\nthat, free to wander as they are, the cattle might gradually\nbecome wild and unmanageable, as formerly in California, or\nas still in the Southern Pampas. I have heard, however, no\ncomplaint on this score. By a simple expedient indeed\u2014\nresorted to formerly at the interior posts, as well as by the\nIndians for their horses, and practised, I do not doubt, by the\nmodern settlers\u2014the herds can be readily attracted homeward\nduring the summer season. While the hills are free from flies\nat night, during the heat of the day the animals eagerly seek\nrefuge from their attacks. The smoke from a smouldering fire,\nmaintained near the homestead, readily attracts them; and,\nonce accustomed, they afterwards habitually resort to it. This, 58\nCLIMATE, AGRICULTURE, &C.\nhowever trivial the relation may appear, is by no means an\nunimportant consideration, for the ulterior effect produced:\nand thus even the gad-fly, pest though it be, is not without\nits uses.* On the whole it may be safely affirmed that there\nexist throughout the region great facilities for rearing cattle on\nan extended scale, so far only very partially availed of.\nSheep thrive well in the Interior, but, so far, no large flocks\nexist. The paucity of their numbers, indeed, has prevented\nthe establishment of a woollen-factory which was projected\nabout three years ago. The abandonment of this project is to\nbe regretted, as its prosecution would at once have given an\nimpetus to a branch of pastoral industry which, failing a convenient market for its product, has so far been only partially\nattended to\u2014and then rather for the butcher than the weaver.\nThere are, however, extensive tracts which I can recall to\nmind which seem specially adapted for the pasturing of very\nextensive flocks.

The device mentioned in the text may be\nregarded as at least a partial adaptation of a similar natural cause.\nThe mosquitoes, on the other hand, execrate them as we may while\nsuffering from their punctures, are presumably not without their\ndirect utility in the order of Nature. I have never been able to\ndiscover what the creatures feed upon when a living subject fails\nthem\u2014for they are always apparently fasting. It may be assumed,\nat any rate, that these tiny tormentors consume, or absorb in some\nmysterious way, subtile gases, the result of humidity and decaying\nvegetation, which might else be noxious to Man. I have alluded\nto the prevalence of these insects at certain seasons upon the Lower\nFraser; and may add that, though not generally prevalent, they\nare also found in a minor degree along the wooded water-courses\nof the Interior. Where they exist they are certainly troublesome\nat times ;'but it may be fairly questioned how far the Country in\nits unimproved state would be habitable without them\u2014if this be\nany comfort to the afflicted; for it is noticeable that when the conditions that produce these insects are modified or removed, they\nvanish with them The further consideration of this abstruse enquiry, however, I leave to those curious in the arcana of entomology\u2014and I crave pardon for the digression.

Of course, as\nin all other countries, occasional epidemics run their course:\nbut as far as the intrinsic healthiness of the climate, throughout, is concerned, nothing is left to be desired. The warm dry\nclimate of the inland summer, it may be observed, is specially\nfavorable in cases of pulmonary disease: and in a more marked degree as we approach the Southern frontier.

I would fain avoid the\nimputation of seeking, possibly, to draw a picture too highly\ncoloured; but I am free, nevertheless, to state my own personal convictions in all sincerity. I conceive of no country\npresenting greater solid attractions. The varied climate and\ncapabilities of the several sections, whereby diversity of taste\nis accommodated; the general salubrity and proved fertility\nof the whole; the magnificent commercial prospects that\nloom in the not distant future j and, not least, the genuine\nhome-feeling which impresses every English settler whose\nlot has hitherto been cast within the Province\u2014all combine\nto recommend it as a future home for those who, weary of\nthe Old World, are bent on seeking a wider scene for the\nexpansion of their energies, amid | fresh fields and pastures\nnew.\nwith almost miraculous celerity.

Elsewhere, and in the interior\nare doubtless valuable and extensive tracts yet to be developed.\nIts exhaustless coal-fields are, however, the great feature of Vancouver Island\u2014pointing to it as the future manufacturing emporium of the Pacific. Its agricultural claims, though very substantial, must be regarded as secondary to those of the mainland.\nma 62\nTERMS OF LAND GRANTS.\nject, born or naturalized, may enjoy the right to pre-empt,\nunder certain stated conditions, a tract not exceeding three\nhundred and twenty acres in extent, to the northward and\neastward of the Cascade Range of Mountains; and one hundred and sixty acres in extent in other parts of the Province.\nPersonal occupation during a period of four years, (intervals\nof absence when necessary being permitted), and improvements to the value of two dollars and fifty cents per acre, are\nnecessary to complete the pre-emptive right. On proof of\nthis, the title is finally issued by the Government, on the\npayment of such sum, not exceeding one dollar per acre, as\nmay be determined upon by the Governor for the time being.\nThis payment, if required, may be extended, in equal instalments, over a period of four years after the pre-emptive right\nis established, and the necessary surveys made. Power, at\nthe same time, is reserved to the Governor in Council to\nmake such free, or partially free, grants of the unoccupied\nand unappropriated Crown Lands of the Province, for the\nencouragement of immigration, or other purposes of publio\nadvantage, as may seem advisable.\nFor pastoral purposes very great facilities exist, beyond\nthe limits actually pre-empted. In every part of the Central\nDistrict extensive ranges of hilly or partially wooded land,\nrich in the finest pasture, are accessible. These may be regarded as common-land: but each bond fide pre-emptor is\npermitted to lease, in the vicinity of his farm, a tract of unoccupied land for pastoral purposes, to which, during his\nlease, he possesses the exclusive right. Eligible portions of\nsuch leased lands, however, are open to pre-emption, meanwhile, by intending settlers: the lessee, of course, being entitled to claim a corresponding deduction from the trifling\namount of rent he may be required to pay.\nThe upset price of Surveyed Lands, for agricultural purposes, is fixed at one dollar per acre; subject to public sale\nin lots, at.certain intervals, to the highest bidder.

The products of the farm command, consequently, always a remunerative price. .\nOwing to the high rate of wages current for European\nlabour, Indian laborers are largely employed. These can be\nobtained at a comparatively cheap rate; and for most purposes connected with agriculture and fishing they are very\nefficient. Being cheerful, obedient, and generally industrious,\nthe services of the young men are of much local value.\nI have before noticed the principal routes of communication with the Interior, and it seems needless to dwell with\nminuteness on this point. A brief summary may, however,\nbe given. There is a regular steamer-service twice a week, or\noftener when necessary, between Victoria and New Westminster ; the running time being about six hours. Thence\nlarge stern-wheel steamers navigate the Fraser as high as\nYale j the ascent occupying a day or more, according to the\ncondition of the water. From Yale there is a weekly mail-\nservice by stages, up to BarkervUle, in the heart of the\nCaribou mining region. Transport along this line of road is\nperformed with waggons drawn by mules or oxen; relieved,\nwhen required, by a steamer which runs from Soda Creek,\ntwenty miles below Alexandria, to Quesnel, forty miles above\nthat point; or some twenty miles higher when necessary.\nThe navigation is then interrupted by a rapid, the ascent of\nwhich is not attempted. Above this point there is a clear\nnavigation for steamers for a distance of sixty miles, to within twenty miles of Fort George, where another rapid, impracticable for steamers, occurs. From this point upwards,\nboth by the Stuart and Fraser Lake Branch, and in the direction of TSte Jaune's Cache, there are stretches very favorable for steam-navigation: but the occasional breaks are a 64\nROADS, <fcc.\ngreat drawback. Nevertheless, with the extension of the\nmining operations these will doubtless in time be made available, in parts, so as to meet the increased demand for transport j and inducements for settlement thus arise in the\nupper portion of the Province which do not at present exist.\nThe route of access to the mining-region on the heads of\nthe Peace River, known generally as the Omineca Mines, to\nwhich I have before casually alluded, has the great advantage of shortness of land-travel, and consequently of economy,\nto persons desiring to proceed thither from Victoria. By\nthis route the first stage is, by steamer to Port Essington,\nabout three days voyage. Thence the Skeena River is ascended by boat or canoe, as far as the Babine Forks*; after\nwhich the remainder of the distance to the mining locality\n(estimated at from 180 to 200 miles) is performed partly on\nfoot, partly by water on the intervening lakes, As I have\nperhaps before remarked, both lines of approach to these\nmines have their advocates; and each has in some respect\nan advantage. For the introduction of live stock it is needless to say that the route from the Interior is the only one at\npresent used.\nTo the excellent natural roads that traverse the country\nin most parts, I have already alluded. I may add that liberal\nappropriations for the improvement of these roads in all directions are annually made.\"j\" Thus constantly increasing\nfacilities of access to the main lines of transit are afforded.\nThe completion of these last, as has been remarked, involved\na very large outlay, aud bore hardly on the early resources\nof the Province.

The improved financial condition of the\nProvince, however, since the Confederation with the Dominion, has enabled the Government, during the recent session\nof the Legislature, to repeal this tax: and all the communications are now entirely free.\nBy the terms agreed upon on the admission of British\nColumbia into the Canadian Confederation, the Government\nof the Dominion undertakes, among other things, to construct\na Railway from Canada. to the Pacific, through British Columbia, within a period of ten years.* In July of 1871,\nalmost simultaneously with the proclamation of our new\npolitical relations, the surveys were vigorously commenced\non the Pacific water-shed, in connexion with those already\nin progress on the Eastern slopes. It would be vain to\naugur, by anticipation, how soon the great work in question\nmay be accomplished; or to speculate on the unforeseen\nfacilities for its completion which will probably be found to\nexist. It may, however, be permitted to indicate generally\nthe line, up to a certain point, which the road will probably\nfollow, from the Saskatchewan westward. Leaving that\nriver near Fort Edrnonxon, a line of country bordering on\nthe divide between the Saskatchewan and the Athabasca,\npresenting no engineering difficulties of moment, is available\nup to the Rocky Mountains. Entering the Pass at Jasper's\nHouse, the line then diverges up Miette's River, across the\nheight of land, and down the Fraser to the vicinity of Moose\nLake or Tete Jaune's Cache, before noticed. Thence by\nthe heads of the Cranberry Fork, and down the North Branch\nof the Thompson.\nIt is of course impossible to predict the conclusion at\nwhich the engineers may arrive after a full survey of the\nseveral passes shall have been effected : but some of the advantages possessed by the route in question may be briefly\nstated.\n* See Appendix L.\u2014Terms of Union. 66      PROBABLE LINE OF CANADIAN PAOIMO RAILWAY.\nThe Pass by the heads of the Miette * and the Fraser is\nso gradual of ascent, with so few obstacles worthy of consideration, that it may be characterized almost as a natural road.\nIts shortness and directness with regard to the probable terminus on the Pacific Coast, give it moreover an advantage\nover any other line of approach : and although the depth of\nsnow at the summit, during winter, is much greater than I\nhave seen gravely stated, there is far less than by any other\nPass with which I am acquainted, either from personal observation or report. The snow, too, through the effects of\ncertain natural phenomena which here prevail, and for which\nI do not profess to account, becomes more compacted, consequently does not drift in an equal degree, and is therefore in\nall respects more manageable than elsewhere; The importance of this consideration is material j bearing in mind that\nthe stoppages upon the Union Pacific Railway during the\npast winter arose chiefly from drift.\nIt is a curious fact that, in the valley of the Athabasca,\nupon this line of transit, for a distance of thirty miles or\nmore both above and below Jasper's House, the snow never\naccumulates. There is constant grass : and the large herds\nof horses formerly kept there by the Hudson's Bay Company,\nfor transport over the mountains, wintered there, fat, upon\nthe natural pasture. Crossing by this Pass many years ago, *\non his way from the Saskatchewan, the writer found, in the\nmonth of January during a winter of almost unexampled\nseverity, that the snow had entirely disappeared from the\nimmediate banks of the river, at the mouth of the Cranberry\n* Some of these names are destined to be perpetuated, and in\nany future account of the Province it might be well to\nnotice them. Miette, for example, known in his time as the\n\"Bon-homme Miette,\" whose name this river bears, was an old\nvoyageur of the North-west Company, who first ascended the\nstream on a trapping-tour. There is a conspicuous rock near\nJasper's House\u2014forming, as it were, with the opposite hills, the\nportal of the pass\u2014which likewise bears his name.

A warm wind prevailed, accompanied at intervals\nby a gentle rain. It could only be inferred that this warm\ncurrent, extending through the Pass, exercised a modifying\ninfluence there ; and, spreading afterwards through the\nJasper's Valley, produced the effects noted. As these effects,\nhowever, are known to be constant in the latter named locality, we way infer that the same cause is likewise constant.\nI may remark, passingly, that similar effects are also produced in a marked degree in other parts of British Columbia:\nbut, as before mentioned, I do not profess to account for\nthese phenomena in all their bearings. Such conclusions\ncould be arrived at only after minute and protracted observation; and are beyond the scope of the passing traveller, bent\non penetrating through the wilderness, and eager to get\nhome.*\nThe point at which the projected Railway will be made to\nstrike the Coast, is still a problem to be solved. Bute Inlet,\nnorth of Nanaimo, is the most eligible, provided it shall be\nfound practicable to bridge the Narrows of Johnstone's Strait,\nand thus continue the line to Esquimalt. Otherwise a point\nfurther South, perhaps Burrard's Inlet, will probably be\nselected; with a steam ferry to Nanaimo, and thence again\nby rail to Esquimalt,\u2014the great natural terminus which it\nis indispensable to attain. In any case the line, after descending the North Branch of the Thompson (assuming the route\nby Jasper's to be the one preferred) will have to diverge to\nthe westward, and approach the Fraser through some of the\ndepressions near Bridge Creek. It is bootless, however, to\nanticipate that which the surveys now in progress will soon\ndecide.\nOn the whole it has been made apparent, by the explorations already effected, that the difficulties in the way of accomplishing the grand national object in view, are far less\n* See Note- m$\n68      PROBABLE LINE OF CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.\nthan were expected. Hence, with the vigorous determination to proceed that has been manifested, we may regard the\nundertaking as in a fair way for speedy accomplishment.\nIts future effects in a national point of view, and especially\nthe influence it is destined to exercise on the immediate\ninterests of this Province, might well be left to the imagination of the reader; nevertheless, I may hazard a few remarks,\nwhich, if superfluous as regards some, may not be without\ninterest for many.\nAn undertaking of this nature is not, of course, to be regarded from a merely local point of view : its successful\ncompletion involves the future commercial interests, not only\nof England in particular, but of other nations also. I think\nit is in the work of Lord Milton and Dr. Cheadle that the\nroute is significantly termed the \"True North-West Passage;\" just as the Suez Canal may be designated that of the\nSouth-east; and as such, in its general relations, we will\nregard it. It is, however, with reference to Great Britain\nalone that I shall consider the subject, albeit imperfectly.\nOur active and enterprising competitors for commercial supremacy, the United States, have already, for three years\npast, had a line in full operation to San Francisco; of which\nthe signal success presents noteworthy encouragement for\nother enterprises of a similar nat uro. As far back as 1866,\nhowever, as appears by a pamphlet which lies before me,*\nwhile yet this success as a pecuniary question was problematic, a second over-land Railway, called the Northern Pacific,\nwas projected; the proposed terminus of which, in Washington Territory\u2014still I believe undecided\u2014was either at Seattle\non Admiralty Inlet, or Olympia at the head of Puget Sound,\ndistant respectively about 85 and 150 miles above Esquimalt,\nthe proposed Canadian terminus, on Fuca's Strait. The last-\nnamed enterprise, however, though not formally abandoned,\n* Northern Pacific Railway. Memorial, Correspondence, and\nReport of Engineer in Chief. Washington, 1868.

ESTIMATE OF DISTANCES. 68\nhas not apparently been, so far, prosecuted with the wonted\nenergy of our neighbours. Last in the field is that of which\nwe now specially treat\u2014the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nI subjoin a comparative statement of the distances by these\nseveral routes, compiled chiefly from a pamphlet by the late\nMr. Alfred Waddington,* and that before alluded to. I have\nnot, I may add, attempted to verify the estimates in either,\nbut accept both as nearly correct:\u2014\nNew York to San Francisco (Railway in operation).\nDistance from New York, by Chicago, to Cmaha\non the Missouri  1,531 miles.\nFrom Omaha to San Francisco, about  1,830\nEnglish miles....-    3,361\nNorthern Pacific Railway (projected).\nFrom New York to Superior City, on Lake Superior, about  1,500\nTo Judith Mountains, Long. 109\u00b0 W  895\nTo Columbia River, above Walla Walla  660\nTo Seattle or Olympia, on Puget Sound,about 220\n  1,775\nEnglish miles    3,215\nCanadian Pacific Railway (projected).\nFrom Montreal to Ottawa, via the Ottawa River     115\nFrom Ottawa to Bute Inlet, about  2,885\n3,000\nHead of Bute Inlet to Esquimalt, 85 miles nearer\nto the Ocean than Seattle, about      200\nEnglish miles    3,200\nWith reference to the commerce of the East\u2014if it be not\nparadoxical to term that the East which we are now approaching from the contrary direction\u2014the following considerations\nmay be noted. Assuming Yokohama, in Japan, for a starting\npoint, the direct distance to Esquimalt may be taken, in\nround numbers, at about 4,200 geographical miles; equal to\nabout a month's voyage of a sailing vessel.f    Canton is pro-\n* Overland Route through British North America, by Alfred\nWaddington.    London, 1868.\nf The Flying Squadron, reaching Esquimalt in May, 1870, performed the voyage, under sail, in 26 days\u2014but this was regarded ro\nESTIMATB OP DI8TANCES.\nbably about a fortnight farther, in point of time. Measured\nacross the map, San Francisco may be regarded as equidistant. The actual distance necessary to be traversed by a\nsailing vessel in order to reach that port is, however, considerably greater; as will appear from the following remarks\nwhich I find quoted from a recognised authority of the highest standings\u2014Professor Maury, of Washington. \" The trade\n\" winds place Vancouver Island on the wayside of the road\n\" from China and Japan to San Francisco so completely, that\n\" a sailing vessel trading under canvas to the latter place,\n\" would take the same route as if she were bound for Vancouver Island. So that all return cargoes would naturally come\n\" there in order to save two or three weeks, besides risk and\n\" expense.\" Hence it is manifest that the Canadian Pacific\nRailway, terminating at EsquimaH>r-and in a minor degree\nthe projected Northern Pacific Railway, owing to the perversities of the inland navigation necessary to reach its proposed\nterminus\u2014would possess a great advantage over the. line,\nnow in operation, from San Francisco to New York. The\nlast-named port, moreover\u2014about equidistant from Liverpool\nor London with Montreal\u2014is considerably farther than\nHalifax, to which point it would be necessary to extend the\ntransport during the period of closed-navigation of the St.\nLawrence. This necessity would involve a further land-\ntransport of 482 miles, by the Intercolonial Railway now in\noperation: but then the shipping point on the Atlantic would\nbe some five hundred miles nearer to England than is New\nYork. Hence it is obvious that the route now under process\nof survey, if the foregoing estimates be nearly correct, presents the advantage, as from China to England, of some\nseven hundred miles over the projected Northern Pacific\nRailway; and, under the consideration advanced by Professor Maury, of more than a thousand over the present route\nby San Francisco.\nas an unusually short voyage. Probably from 30 to 35 days might\nbe considered a fair ran. In connexion with this subject see Note\u2014\nAppendix D-3. wp.m\nWOTES ON TRAFFIC LIKELY TO ENSUE. 71\nAs a pecuniary investment the Central, or Union, Pacific\nRailway has been so far very successful, as will appear by\nthe following statement, issued by the Company, which I\nextract from a late number of the San Francisco Bulletin:\u2014\n\" Official Statement of business for the three fiscal years,\nending April 30, 1872.\n1869-70 1870-71 1871-72\nGross earnings $8,364,593    $7,333,961    $7,679,753\nExpenses     5,797,099      3,898,704      4,062,914\nNet earnings  $2,567,494   $3,435,257    $3,616,839 \"\nThe sources of the above income are, the sale of land-\ngrants along the line, and the enormous traffic, local and\nfrom abroad, that has been developed. The outlay is incurred by payment of current interest on Bonds, and running\nexpenses.*\nWhen first the project of constructing a line across the\nContinent to San Francisco was mooted, sceptical vaticinators\naugured that it would, at best, be available for the transport\nof the lightest and most costly description of goods, only. To\nshow how groundless these anticipations have proved, I subjoin\na memorandum of the receipts on two successive days of the\npresent season, casually quoted in a recent number of the\nWeekly Bulletin, above referred to. \" The receipts of freight\n\" by railroad yesterday included 2 cars of Agricultural Im-\nI plements; 200 cases Alcohol; 18 cases Boots ; 1 car, and\n154 packages Bacon ; 40 packages Eggs; 74 tierces Hams;\n1906 cases Cheese; 97 boxes Lard ; 35 kits Mackarel; 10\n\" barrels Neats-foot Oil; 35 barrels Lard Oil; 907 bundles\n\"Paper; 44'barrels Pork; 1 car Shovels; 488 cases and 65\n| packages Tobacco; 48 barrels Whiskey; and 640 bundles\nI Wire.\" Again: | The receipts of freight by railroad yes-\nI terday included 1 car Bacon; 155 cases Boots; 10 cases\n% Cheese; 10 packages Cordage; 24 bundles Iron Tubes j\n* Supplementary to the above statement the estimated gross income for May is given at $812,000. The actual earnings for the\nprevious month were $724,446. MMWm\n72 ADVANTAGES OF -ESQUIMALT AS THE WESTERN SEAPORT.\n\" 34 bundles Iron; 6 packages Leather; 2 Pianos; and 355\n\"packages Tobacco.\"\nThe return-freights from San Francisco are of varied char-\nacter; including fresh fruits, flour, wines, and other articles,\nthe product of California; and entire cargoes of Teas and other\nmerchandise from China and Japan. British Columbia affords\nher quota of patronage in both directions; and recently, I am\ninformed, the Hudson's Bay .Company forwarded from Victoria\nto San Francisco a number of casks of valuable Furs, for\ntransmission. thence, overland and by steamer, to London; at\nmost a three-weeks passage.\nI shall not, I trust, be suspected of arguing from a purely\nlocal stand-point, when I indicate briefly some of the advantages which Esquimalt presents as the future terminus of the\nDominion Railway. The feasibility of bridging the Narrows\nopposite to Bute Inlet is, as I have remarked, still undecided:*\notherwise the question would be one simply of cost; which,\nall other considerations admitted, would be of inferior moment.\nBut, whether by bridging here, or with the intervention of a\nferry from some other point, it is necessary to the full measure\nof future success that the line should be continued to the extreme limit I have named. Lying immediately within the\nbroad Estuary of De Fuca's Strait, Esquimalt seems destined\nby Nature as the future emporium of a vast commerce. Its\nsplendid harbour is at all times readily accessible from seaward ; and, with a light-house which stands some ten miles\n'westward, and another which, like the Pharos of another\nAlexandria, indicates the immediate entrance, it may be\nsecurely approached and entered at any hour, by day or night.\nIt is not, however, upon this ground alone that the position is\n* In a former chapter I have mentioned that the channel at this\npoint does not exceed a few thousand yards in breadth\u2014the exact\nmeasurement I have not at hand. It is here, however, necessary\nto explain that a large island, called Valdez Island,'separates the\nwhole channel into two parts, each of which is narrowed, at points\nlying diagonally to each other, to very small dimensions. The\ndepth of the water, and the strong effects of the tides, appear to be\nthe chief engineering difficulties to be encountered.\niJjjrL--!: t\u00aby&.\u00ab~\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n78\nfounded. Above Esquimalt the navigation, though still good,\nis rendered more uncertain through the effect of cross-tides\nand baffling winds; and especially to reach a comparatively\nremote point like Bute Inlet. This difficulty, it will be suggested, might be overcome, with a certain outlay, by the employment of tug-boats: but there is another incidental difficulty, prolific of delay, against which it is impossible to provide.\nThis is the occasional interruption of the inland navigation with\nlarge craft, at times by dense smoke from forest-fires, at times\nby fog, and sometimes by the combined effects of both. The\nautumn, chiefly, is the season when these impediments might\nbe anticipated: and under the circumstances mentioned,\nserious delays might occasionally occur to the shipping, which,\nthe terminus being at Esquimalt, would be avoided.\nAs regards the speedy completion of the work that has been\nundertaken, a few words may be said. I am aware that there\nare some who, whether really sceptical or not, profess to doubt\neither the power or the inducement to carry it through. In\nthe uncertainty of these doubters I do not share. With a line\ndevoid for the most part of engineering difficulties, traversing,\nwith few interruptions, a region conspicuous for its fertility\nand its pastoral advantages, and fringing elsewhere a tract\nteeming with mineral riches, the local inducements are surely\ngreat: and beyond these are the wide commercial interests\nwhich I have feebly endeavoured to indicate. Up to a certain\nperiod, indeed, many, and myself among the number, questioned the probability of the enterprise being seriously considered for many years : but the declaration of the Terms of\nUnion, and the prompt and energetic action of the Dominion\nGovernment since, in fulfilment of their engagements, preclude\nthe question of doubt. To repeat it, then, is to question the\ngood faith of the Administration: a mark of disrespect, or\nwant of confidence which, by its liberal and manly treatment\nof the Province, it has not certainly deserved. The preliminary\nsurveys completed, and the line decided, active operations will\nbe commenced simultaneously at both ends: and all augury IP '#^f-\n74\nGENERAL REMARKS.\nis fallacious if the grand undertaking be not soon an accomplished fact. To Mr. Alfred Waddington, I may add, from\nwhose pamphlet I have quoted, and whose acquaintance I enjoyed in Victoria, is due, not indeed the conception, but certainly the earnest advocacy of this important national work.\nThrough ^him the project was first introduced in a tangible\nform to the British public; to its furtherance the whole energies of his latter years were devoted; and it was while thus\nengaged that he recently died at Ottawa\u2014I believe of smallpox. The death of this worthy gentleman, while the pet project of his life was still in embryo, created much sympathy in\nVictoria, as elsewhere: and I do not resist the opportunity\nwhich I now have, of paying at least this passing tribute to\nhis memory.\nBefore leaving this topic I ought not to omit to notice an\nincidental advantage which the route I have indicated across\nthe Rocky Mountains possesses over all the rest, and of which\nthe importance does not at first appear. It is the freedom from\nall danger of Indian molestation. In conversation, not long\nago, with Sir James Douglas, the former Governor of the\nColony, whose great local knowledge and sound judgment in\nthese matters it is needless to dwell upon, I drew his attention\nto this point, and he agreed with me in ascribing to it very\ngreat weight. Crossing the Saskatchewan at Carlton, the line\nwould pass through a country occupied by the Crees\u2014a\nfriendly and inoffensive tribe. Leaving the Cree tract near\nEdmonton, and proceeding towards Jasper's, a few scattered\nfamilies of Strong-wood Assineboines alone wander over the\ncountry\u2014poor, harmless, and hospitable, whose sole care\nis to hunt and live. West of the Pass, by the heads\nof the North Branch of the Thompson, some scattered\nShew-shwaps hunt and fish for a livelihood. To reach the\nSouthern Passes, on the other hand, it is necessary to pass\nthrough a tract frequented by the roving tribes of the broad\nPrairie, including those Arabs of the West, the Blackfeet. It\ndoes not indeed follow that collision with these must neceeea-\nj&ffrajag POLITICAL CONSTITUTION.\n75\nrily ensue: but the risk is there; and it might involve, in\ntime, the necessity of maintaining a permanent military force\nto guard against attack; just as the United States Government\nis compelled, under similar circumstances, to do, for the safety\nof travellers by the Southern Railway.\nCHAPTER IX.\nPolitical Constitution\u2014Schools\u2014Churches, &c.\u2014\nPostal Service\u2014Telegraphs\u2014Mechanics' Institutes, &c. \u2014 Newspapers \u2014 Banks \u2014 Population \u2014\nIndians\u2014General Remarks on Gold Mining\u2014Mineral Riches\u2014Coal-Mining, &c.\u2014General Remarks\non the attractions of the province as a field for\nSettlement.\nThe Government of British Columbia, as of the other Provinces provided for under the \" British North America Act,\n1867,\" is administered, by a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed\nby the Governor-General of Canada. The gentleman now\nfilling this important position is the Honorable Joseph W.\nTrutch, formerly Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works in\nthe ci-devant Colony.\nThe responsible advisers of the Lieutenant-Governor are\nthree in number; occupying respectively the offices of Provincial Secretary, Attorney-General, and Chief Commissioner of\nLands and Works. Provision is made by the Constitution of\nthe Province that the number may, if found advisable, be increased to five.\nThe Legislature is composed of a single House, styled the\nLegislative Assembly, and consisting of twenty-five members\nreturned by twelve Electoral Districts, as under; viz.:\u2014On SCHOOLS.\nVancouver Island: Victoria City, 4; Victoria District, 2;\nEsquimalt, 2 ; Cowitchan, 2 ; Nanaimo, 1; Comox, 1. On\nthe Mainland: New Westminster City, 1; New Westminster\nDistrict, 2; Yale District, 3; Lillooet, 2; Caribou District, 3;\nKootanais District, 2. The expenses of the members during\nthe session of the Legislature are paid by the Province; and\nthere is an allowance for travelling expenses to and fro.\nThe franchise, confined to British subjects, born or naturalized, is so liberal as to be almost equivalent to manhood suffrage. The elections are for four years: the voting done by\nopen poll.\nForeign residents may acquire all the rights of British subjects, within the Province, through a very simple and inexpensive process of naturalization.\nThe Province returns six members to the House of Commons at Ottawa; and three Senators are appointed by the\nGovernor-General to the Upper House. The expenses of these\nRepresentatives are defrayed by the Dominion.\nThe only direct general tax levied in the Province is for the\nmaintenance of Roads, and is expended within the Districts\nwhere levied. This tax is an- annual poll-tax of two dollars\neach on every male resident above eighteen years of age. In\naddition the owners of land are charged, for the same purpose,\nfour cents per acre on their land, beyond the limit of 10 acres.\nA well-devised law for establishing free Schools, unsectarian\nin character, throughout the Province, is now in force. A\nSuperintendent of Education has been appointed under the\nAct; and a Board of Education, consisting of six members,\nholds its sittings in Victoria. Local details are superintended\nby Trustees, elected in each School District. As will be seen\nby reference to the Appendix, liberal allowance has been made\nin the Estimates (since voted) for carrying out the provisions of this important law. Among other definitions of the\nduties of the Board of Education under the recent Act, is the\nfollowing, embodying a provision of great prospective importance : \" To establish a High School in any District where\n*\u2014 \u2022      <- \u2122 \u25a0 .\u00ab_! \u25a0    SSI     >\u25a0 II\n&OT5 CHURCHES, &C.\n77\n\" they may find it expedient so to do, wherein the classics,\n\"mathematics, and higher branches of Education shall be\n\" taught; and such school shall be subject to the same obliga-\n\" tions and regulations as other Public Schools generally.\"\nFor private education Victoria affords good facilities: for\nboys, the Collegiate School; for girls, the Angela College.\nBoth these schools are under the visitorship of the Episcopalian Bishop of the Diocese, the Right Reverend Dr. Hills.\nThere are besides other good schools for pupils of both sexes;\nnoteworthy among which is the excellent establishment conducted by the respected Sisterhood of St. Anne.\nIn Victoria there are two Episcopalian Churches\u2014the\nCathedral of Christ Church, and St. John's; and there is a\nthird at Esquimalt. The Wesleyan community have a well-\nbuilt church, which it has been found necessary recently to\nenlarge. The Presbyterian congregation likewise have a very\nneat church. The Roman Catholics have two commodious\nchurches , the Bishopric of that communion, however, consequently on the death of the late highly respected Bishop,\nthe Sight Reverend Mgr. Demers, being at present vacant.\nIn addition to these places of Christian worship, there is\nthe Jewish synagogue, a substantial edifice of brick. New\nWestminster is the residence of an Archdeacon, the Reverend\nC. T. Woods; and its church has the enviable distinction of\npossessing the only set of bells in the Province; a fine peal,\npresented to the congregation by the same amiable Christian\nlady whose name I have had occasion already several times to\nmention\u2014the present Baroness Coutts. Elsewhere in the\nvarious Districts, where congregations can be assembled, there\nare established facilities for public worship, and small churches\nhave been built here and there ; in other parts, necessarily,\nit is only by occasional visits, at stated intervals, that the religious wants of the community are met.*\nThe Judicature of the Province is composed of a Chief\nJustice, and, at present, one Puisne Judge\u2014a second one, it\n* Hospitals, see Appendix W. 78\nPOSTAL SERVICE\u2014TELEGRAPHS\u2014NEWSPAPERS.\nis understood, to be shortly appointed. At Victoria and\nother principal stations there are Stipendiary Magistrates,\nwho act also as Judges of the County Courts: in other parts\norder is maintained by Honorary Justices of the Peace. The\nvigilance of the Magistracy, and the salutary rigour of the\nJudges, have repressed that tendency to violence and crime\nwhich is assumed, however erroneously, to be inseparable\nfrom young communities such as this. In brief, the laws\nare here as vigorously administered, and there is as much\nsecurity for life, limb, and property, as in the oldest Provinces of the Dominion\u2014and this, if my meaning be duly apprehended, is saying not a little on the question of law and\norder.\nThe Postal Service of the Province is now entirely in the\nhands of the General Government of the Dominion; and\nwhatever deficiency may exist in the details of the system as\nlately re-organized, will shortly be remedied. A special Agent,\nit is understood, is now on the way from Ottawa to place\nthese matters on an unexceptionable footing. At present\nthere is a direct mail from Europe and Canada, by way of\nSan Francisco, twice a month; reaching the latter place by\nrailway, and brought thence to Victoria by a subsidized\nsteamer. There is also an overland mail twice a week from\nSan Francisco to Olympia, on Puget Sound, by which letters\nare, under the present arrangements, less regularly brought.\nFrom Victoria there is a mail-service twice a week to New\nWestminster; and once a week to all other parts of the Province, upon the regular lines of communication. The rates\nof postage will appear in the Appendix.\nThere is constant telegraphic communication between\nEurope and Victoria, by way of New York and San Francisco.\nThe line, which crosses the southern part of the Gulf of\nGeorgia to Victoria by a submerged cable, has a branch extending to the verge of the Caribou region.\nVictoria supports two daily newspapers, the British Colonist and the Standard, which also reappear in a weekly form. MECHANICS' INSTITUTES\u2014BANKS\u2014POPULATION.      79\nNew Westminster has likewise two, the Dominion Pacific\nHerald and the Mainland Guardian. The Upper Country\nboasts of one; a useful publication, called the Caribou\nSentinel.\nAt Victoria and several other of the towns, Mechanics'\nInstitutes and Reading Rooms have been established. At\nthese, besides the standard collection of books that has been\naccumulated, the latest European and American periodicals,\nwith the principal newspapers from abroad, can always be\nperused.\nThere are three principal Banks in Victoria, with branches\nelsewhere: the Bank of British North America, the Bank of\nBritish Columbia, and Wells, Fargo, & Co.\u2014the last an\nAmerican firm, too widely known on this Continent to require more than mention. In addition to their banking\nbusiness the last-named carry on an Express Agency, ramifying throughout Christendom. Through their means the\nmost important business may be transacted: and any article of use or luxury, from a piano probably to a penny whistle, can be readily obtained. This institution, originating in\nthe early necessities of the California Mines, has been of\nmarked utility and success: and there are probably few*\ndwellers upon the Pacific Coast who have not been at some\ntime indebted to the care or the courtesy of the Agents of\nWells, Fargo's Express. The several Banks allow interest\non time-deposits of three months or upwards. In addition to\nthe private Banks there is a public Savings Bank, of great\nutility in its way.\nThe population of British Columbia, owing to the fluctuations of mining success, has varied much. At no time very\nlarge, it does not now probably exceed twelve thousand\nEuropeans, of whom one-half reside in Victoria and its immediate environs. The permanent inhabitants of the city,\nby a census of 1870, amounted to 4,208, in the proportion of\n2,528 males to 1,680 females. No reliable census of the\nwhole Provinoe, however, exists, so that any estimate made\ni 80\nINDIANS.\ncan be merely an approximation. With the recently improved prospects of the country, it is needless to say that\nimmigration is again setting in ; and it is noticeable that\nO O CD S\nformer residents, who had left under discouragements real or\nfancied, are now eagerly returning.\nThe Indian population, on the other hand, is numerous;\nand as the Indians are producers as well as consumers, they\nform an important element in the consideration of the commercial relations of the Province. For the rest, it may be\nremarked that they are strictly under the law; and that, with\nthe appliances at command, no difficulty is experienced in\nexacting obedience. In saying that the native population is\nnumerous J ought to confine the remark to the immediate\nvicinity of the Coast. In the interior they are comparatively\nfew, and sparsely distributed. In many points, too, the\nIndians of the interior are far mors engaging in character\nthan those of the sea-board. These last, however, are of a\nmore ingenious turn. They excel in many simple manufactures, and are not a little advanced in divers,mechanical arts.\nI was shown, for instance, by a gentleman in Victoria, a fine\nmeerschaum pipe, which, having been accidentally damaged,\nhad been entrusted for repair to an Indian workman. Beating out a gold-coin he had remounted the article with a skill\ncomparable with that of the most practised goldsmith. It\nhas already been mentioned that the services of the young\nmen among the natives are turned to good account in agri-\ncultural and other pursuits. I may add that, beydhd this,\nlittle has been done for their improvement, save through\nthe efforts of private individuals, and the exertions of the\nMissionaries of various denominations who are in the field.\nThe Government has been unpardonably supine: and it is\ngratifying to know that, under the new political relations of\nthe Province, the care of this branch of the population devolves upon the Dominion; and that a sound system of\nIndian policy will soon be organized, from which the most\nbeneficial results may be anticipated.\nre**'.*;\n?^m GENERAE BEMARKS ON GOLD-MINING.\n81\nThe mining interests of British Columbia are of too great\nimportance to be treated of summarily in a brief treatise\nsuch as this. A reference to the Appendix will show, however, the large recorded export of Gold for many years past :*\nbut so much is conveyed away by private hand that the real\nproduct of the mines, of course, cannot be ascertained. The\nwriter has no practical knowledge of the subjeet of mining,\nand he is averse to give currency to reports of the richness\nof this locality or of that; which, however apparently well\nfounded, too often prove fallacious. Large fortunes have\nbeen made, and large fortunes will continue still to be occasionally made, in this exciting pursuit, within the precincts\nof the Province: but while some have thus become rich,\nothers have only been comparatively lucky, while others\nagain have failed almost entirely of success. He cannot,\nhowever, do better than quote on this subject the following\nexcellent remarks, which he finds in a Report of Lieut. H.\nSpencer Palmer, of the Royal Engineers, dated 21st February, 1863; and which, notwithstanding the lapse of time,\nmay be regarded as still generally applicable.\n\" The general tendency of the auriferous ranges throughout the Colony leads to the conjecture that the future ex-\n\" plorations will discover an almost unbroken continuation of\n\" rich deposits maintaining a north-north-westerly direction,\n\"and occupying a large portion of the great elbow of the\n\" Fraser River.\n\" Caribou is closely packed with mountains of considerable\n\" altitude, singularly tumbled and irregular in character, and\n\"presenting steep and thickly wooded slopes. Here and\n\" there tremendous masses, whose summits are from 6,000\n\" to 7,000 feet above the sea, tower above the general level,\n\" and form centres of radiation for subordinate ranges. This\n\"mountain system is drained by innumerable  streams, of\n* Amounting, for the last fourteen years, to between 21 and 22\nmillions of dollars in the aggregate\u2014showing an average exceeding one and a half million yearly, exclusive of the large amounts\nthat have escaped record.

Meanwhile the introduction of machinery,\nwith the aid of capital and engineering skill, promises to\neffect soon a very great change : and though the individual\n* Report of Lieutenant H.

Rich\neopper-leads abound along the Coast. A few years*- ago perhaps a dozen enterprises, for working as many seams, were\nset on foot: but, as might have been foreseen, they all failed\nfrom the cause indicated. Possibly, had all these scattered\nendeavours been concentrated, a better result might have\nbeen obtained. As it was, the scanty resources of each were\nfrittered away\u2014in some cases through sheer ignorance and\nmismanagement: and the conclusion became apparent, that\nwithout the assistance of capital from abroad and the employment of competent conductors, it was vain to persist. So>\nwith certain silver-leads\u2014sufficiently rich it is believed, to\nreward richly the investment of money, but for which confidence has not so far been secured. The G-eologieal Survey\nof the Province which has been undertaken by the Canadian\nQ-overnment, and is now in progress, will doubtless reveal\nmore conspicuously the existence of these latent treasures j\nand we may trust therefore that the day is approaching when\nthis great source of wealth will no longer be neglected.\nThe returns given in the Appendix will show that the\nCoal-mines of Vancouver Island are more favourably circumstanced. The oldest mine at Nanaimo, commenced by the\nHudson's Bay Company, has for the last twelve years been\nthe property of an English Company, bearing the name of\nthe Vancouver Coal Oompany, who share a handsome annual dividend for their investment. There are two other\nmines in the same vicinity: one of these, the Hdrewood,\nowned also by English capitalists, is not at present worked \u25a0\nthe other, the Dunsmuir, is in its infancy, but promises to\nbe very successful. There is also a fine seam of coal, requiring only capital for its working?, at Baynea' Sound, near\ntel^t n. ^/m?^\nCOAL-MINING- &C.\n85\nComox; besides that at the north end of tthe leland, and\nanother of Anthracite on Queen Charlotte's, to which I have\npreviously alluded. In the event of a future treaty -ef Reciprocity with the United States, in which all -the Provinces of\nthe Dominion would of course share, the demand for Coal from\nVancouver Island will receive a great impetus. So far as can\nbe discovered there is no coal of quality at all comparable with\nit elsewhere on the Coast: so that were the present restrictions upon its importation removed, it would take a more\nprominent place in the San Francisco market than it at present occupies.*\nIn 1869 an Ordinance was issued, the declared object df\nwhich is \"to develop the resources of the Colony by affording\n\u25a0\" facilities for the effectual working of Silver, Lead, Tin, Cop-\n\" per, Coal, and other Minerals, other than Gold \"\u2014the last\nbeing specially provided for in a separate Ordinance. Under\nthe provisions of the Act in question, it is in the power of any\nperson, or association of persons, to seek for any of the minerals\nenumerated, under special licence over a given space; rsndt, if\n.^successful in their object, to obtain a Crown grant of the\nlocality, under conditions named. It is under this Act that\nMr. Dunsmuir, who I believe was originally an Overseer or\n.Foreman in the employment of the Vancouver Coal Company,\nand some others, have established their right to what will soon\nbecome, if not already, a very valuable property. Confining\n\u25a0ourselves to the consideration of Coal, and without going into\n\u2022minute particulars, the chief requisites may be succinctly\nstated.\n1. A \"Prospecting Licence'\" is first obtained, on application in due form to the proper authorities, not exceeding tww\u00bb\n* Note P. S.\u2014-Since the above was written the import duty an\nforeign coal entering tie United States has been reduced from\n$1.25 to 75 cents per .ton. Anthracite is admitted duty fr*e.

This licence\nfe obtained upon cause shown, and the payment of a trifling\nfee; and entitles the holder to exclusive mining rights of\nsearch, meanwhile, within the limits described, other than for\ngold.\n2. A Prospecting Licence for Coal alone, may include within the general limits therein defined, not exceeding five hundred acres to each individual applicant, of previously unoccupied land', or two thousand five hundred acres to an association or company consisting of not less than ten persons. The\nlicence carries with it the right to make roads, use timber,\nerect buildings, and other privileges necessary to preliminary\nexplorations'.\n3. If successful in the quest, the final grant is obtained on\nthe following terms\u2014viz.: For any quantity up to and including one thousand aeres, at the price of five dollars per acre :\nprovided always that on proof, to the satisfaction of the Government, that the sum of ten thousand dollars has been beneficially expended on any land held under Prospecting Licence\nfor Coal, a grant of one thousand acres of the land held under\nsuch Prospecting Licence shall be issued to the company holding it, without payment of the upset price of such land.    In\nother words they receive, virtually a bonus of five thousand\ndollars, in consideration of the preliminary expenditure of the\nlarger sum.    Under certain necessary modifications, the same\ngeneral rules apply to mining explorations in quest of the\nother minerals named.    I do not, of course, profess to go into\ndetails; but I may venture generally on this assurance\u2014that\nthe most liberal interpretation to the provisions of the Ordinance is always given by the Government, whether as regards\nindividuals, or associations.*\n* Note P.S.\u2014In the Appendix will be found a description of tbe\nCoal-works in operation at Nanaimo, which has very recently been\nriven by a visitor.

The great riches of Vancouver\nIsland in this invaluable fossil, and the excellent quality of the MM\nATTRACTIONS FOR SETTLEMENT.\n87\nIn conclusion, the general advantages of British Columbia\nas a field for immigration may be briefly summed.\nA temperate climate, remarkably salubrious in its character;\na fertile soil easily brought into cultivation; rich and extensive pastures; abundant natural resources for procuring food;\nland cheaply, if not gratuitously, attainable by the industrious;\ngood government under a liberal constitution; security of life\nand property under\u00bbrigidly executed laws; facilities for religious worship for every denomination; a liberal system of\neducation, free of cost; ready and cheap postal communication\nwith all parts of the world; telegraphic facilities through the\nUnited States to Canada and Europe; a wide and constantly\nextending market, soon to be enormously increased by the\nprogress of the Canadian Pacific Railway and other concomitant enterprises.\nTo this may be added, the early occupation of a Country\ndestined, if all augury be not fallacious, ere long to become,\nin connexion with the Dominion of Canada, one of the most\nimportant and flourishing dependencies of the Imperial Crown.\nThe distance of British Columbia from England, added to the\nuncertainty or ignorance of its resources, has doubtless so far\nacted^against its being regarded favourably as a field for -colonization. A reference to the scale of passages in the Appendix\nwill, [however, show that the objection of distance, at least,\nthrough increased facilities of locomotion, is gradually vanishing. British Columbia is in reality to-day nearer to London,\nin point of time, than was Canada thirty years ago. The cost\nis still an objection ; but even this, it is to be expected, will\nsoon be diminished, if not materially, at least to some extent.\nAt present the command of about \u00a340 is necessary for a second class passenger; thus:\nEngland to New York or Halifax, \u00a36 to \u00a38     $40\nTo San Francisco (Currency) by railway       90\ncoal produced, apart from the commercial advantages directly accruing, point to a great manufacturing future for this part of th\u00ab\nProvince. 8$\nATTRACTIONS FOR SETTLEMENT.\nTo Victoria \t\nIncidental Expenses\n15\n50\nS195\nIt is to be borne in mind, however, that the passage may be\nthus effected within the month; and that consequently the\noverland route is on the whole the cheapest.\nI am aware of no instance where an able-bodied, industrious,\nand sober man, reaching the Province, has failed of success,\nWhat with the gold-mines, the high rate of wages, and the\nconstant demand for labour in different shapes, the good economist can soon establish his footing, and become a thriving\nland-owner. If in this position he may not at once attain to\nopulence, he realizes a competence, and, if he have a family,\ncan bring them up in respectability and comfort,\nI may state an instance, though for obvious reasons I suppress the name. A. B. had been a farm-laborer in Scotland.\nSecuring a steerage passage in a sailing vessel, he reached\nO D J. D\nVictoria in 1862. He at once procured work upon the road\nbetween Victoria and Esquimalt, then in process of improvement, and found that, living well meanwhile, he could lay by\na dollar a day out of his wages. Li the spring he went to the\nInterior of the Mainland, and obtained ready employment;\nsometimes as an assistant to mining-companies, but never\nmining on his own account. At the end of four years he was\nin a position to buy and partially stock a good farm out of the\naccumulation of his savings. He is now a prosperous tanner,\nhaving two hundred acres of good land, all enclosed, and with\na large portion under cultivation; about a score of fine cattle,\nand numerous swine; a good house; substantial farm-buildings; with horses, and all the necessary agricultural implements, including the half-share of a reaping-machine.\nThis is not a solitary case, but is cited as the example of\nmany.\nIn the Central District of the Mainland large fortunes have\nbeen made, by parties who had capita' at the outset, by caltle-\n\u2022*?**% 123 ATTRACTIONS FOR SETTLEMENT.\n89\ngrazing. Two brothers, the Messrs. Harper, citizens of the\nUnited States, from Oregon, may be mentioned as having been\nvery successful in this branch of business. Several English\ngentlemen, it may be added, having a certain command of\nmeans, have settled in various parts of the interior, and are\nrealizing a rapid return for their investments.\nThe fishing interests of the Province have not been so far\nadequately developed. In this branch of business there is\ndoubtless a wide field for enterprise, which will not long be\noverlooked.\nAs regards society few words must suffice: in parts refined?\nit is throughout decorous, hospitable, and intelligent.\nFor the encouragement of immigration an appropriation has\nthis year been made by the Legislature, to the extent of the\nsurplus funds available,\u2014^since increased by an appropriation\nfrom the Federal Government. So far, no settled scheme in\nconnexion with this appropriation has been published; but it\nmay possibly appear in the Appendix. Hitherto a system of\nassisted passages for domestic servants has been at times\nadopted ty private parties; and it is probable that something\nof the same kind may be proposed by the Government with\nregard to general immigrants. In the former case a bond was\nexecuted for the repayment of the sum advanced, in due time\nafter arrival. Female servants, who I may remark are greatly\nin demand, were generally the subjects of these private arrangements; but the issue was not always satisfactory, at least\nto one party in the contract; for the damsels were likewise in\ngreat demand in another direction; and, whatever their personal charms, were generally snapped up in matrimony long\nere their engagements had expired. But we must not quarrel\nwith the issue. If the employers were for a while inconvenienced, a public benefit, and much individual happiness,\n.were promoted; albeit that this expanded view of the question may have borne with it little consolation at the time.\nLeaving aside, however, all question as to the details of the 90\nSUPPLE MENTART.\nscheme that may be contemplated by the Government to promote the end in view, I may venture at least on this general\nassurance\u2014that, whatever the measures adopted, both as\nregards the particular class of immigrants referred to, and\nothers more favorably circumstanced, they will be such as to\ncontribute to the immediate ease, and ultimate prosperity of\nall. And, on the part of the People generally, I may safely\nadd, that a cordial and a hospitable welcome will be cheerfully\nextended to such as may decide on making their future home\nin British Columbia\u2014the youngest daughter of the\nDominion\u2014the fair, and fertile, and happy Province of the\nWest.\nCHAPTER X.\nSupplementary.\nIndians and Indian Missions\u2014State of Society\u2014\nCauses of past retardation of the Province\u2014\nGeneral  progress on  the   Pacific   Coast, with\nEXTENT AND  COST  OF RAILWAYS ALREADY  EXISTING\u2014\u2022\nSpars of British Columbia\u2014Usual Dimensions of\nTHOSE    SHIPPED    TO   VARIOUS    MARKETS\u2014SAN   JUAJf\nQuestion\u2014End.\nThe foregoing pages, with the exception of some few notes\nand addenda made during the progress of the printing\nwere composed and sent in to the Government previous to the\n25th of May, the date originally fixed for the completion of\nthe competitive treatises. An extension of the time for another\nmonth had been meanwhile accorded, of which, ignorant till\ntoo late, the writer could not take advantage. He avails himself, therefore, of the opportunity now afforded, to add a few\nsupplementary remarks, unfettered by the  trammels  under Mm\nSUPPLEMENTARY\"..\n91\nwhich the previous portion was composed, and which seem\ncalled for by circumstances which have since come under his-\nnotice.\nIt seems necessary to put the reader on his guard against\ncertain misrepresentatioos to which British Columbia has been:\nsubjected; and it will not, I trust, be regarded as a case of\nspecial pleading if I attempt to do so. It is true that some\ncandidly-written works have appeared, to which honorable\nreference is made in the resume of the published authorities\nelsewhere given. But other works, again, have been written,\nof quite a contrary tendency : and, the evil report being toe-\noften more readily accepted than the good, the effect of these,\nif we may judge from the comments they have elicited, seems\nto be predominant. Whatever the instigation to such production\u2014whether the disappointment of over-sanguine hopes, the\nexaggerated perception of minor difficulties, or, under a less\ncharitable supposition, the pecuniary inducement \" to make\na book\"\u2014 it > matters not to enquire : but the effect is\nthere. A \" book \" is made; not in the cant acceptation of the\nhabitues of the turf, but in a sense directly important to the\npublic, because productive of a positive injury to many.\nMy attention has been directed to two works coming under\nsome one or other of the terms of the above category, which\nhave recently been published. Upon these I have made, in\nthe Appendix, some passing remarks, certainly not inferring a\nvery favorable judgment, either of the degree of knowledge or\nof good faith by which they are characterized. One of them,\nflourishing in fair type and with a very sensational imaginary\npicture, might well be dismissed, upon its own merits, from\nserious consideration : the other derives factitious importance\nfrom its being honored with notice in a publication so widely\nread and so influential as the Saturday Review, through the\ncolumns of which paper, alone, I am partially acquainted with\nits tenor. These two books, with the remarks of the reviewer\nupon the latter\u2014coldly  expressed and   dubiously worded J*I*^\n32\nINDIANS.\nthough his approbation be\u2014form the text for certain remarks\nwhich I now make, inextension of the cursory notice of the\nsubjects before given.\nI have remarked of the Indian population that, in their relation to the colonists, the services of the young men are\nturned to good account; and that all are strictly under the\nlaw. At the outset of the general colonization of the Country,\nin 1858, it is not improbable that a good many concealed\nmurders of white men took place; for the sudden influx of\nsome twenty or thirty thousand men, ere yet the machinery\nof government was fairly organised, led naturally to many\ndisorders. With the multitude, among a majority of well-\ndisposed persons, no small leaven of the worst characters from\nCalifornia, as might be supposed, was mingled: and it cannot\nbe doubted that in certain cases the aggressions, or brutal\n\u25a0excesses, of such led to retaliation, sometimes upon innocent\nvictims. Previous to this the Hudson's Bay Company,* with\nwhom the administration of the affairs of Vancouver Island at\nthat time rested, under charter from the Imperial Government,\nhad successfully restrained the natives from molesting the few\nsettlers who then occupied a portion of the nascent Colony.\nThe judicious administration of the resident Chief Factor, the\npresent Sir James Douglas, K. C B.\u2014then Governor of Vancouver Island, and afterwards, when disconnected from the\n* The past Hudson's Bay Company\u2014the elSves and successors of\nthe hardy North-wesbers of Montreal and of the original traders of\nHudson's Bay, united toy the Coalition of 1821\u2014are here alluded\nto : a co-partnery of interests between the Stock-holders in London and the Officers in the Country, since terminated, and remodelled on a different basis. Lest it should be supposed, or as\nsome at a distance might be tempted to insinuate, that the Company as now organised still retain a dominant sway in the politics\nof British Columbia, it may be stated that their influence in this\nregard is here no greater than possibly in London\u2014or in Timbuc-\ntoo. The Company of the present day is purely a mercantile\nAssociation, denuded, here as elsewhere, of all its former power\na.nd prestige. As merchants, however, under the excellent local\nmanagement provided, they obtain justly the highest public confidence ; and, with their vast command of capital, exercise a legitimate mercantile influence, in all respects beneficial to tin- Province. INDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS'.\n.93\nCompany, of both sections of the present Province, at first for\nsome years separate\u2014co-operated with the admirable system\nwhich prevailed throughout the Country, in the management\nof the Company's affairs, to maintain an order uninterrupted\nby any serious outbreak. Kindness and consideration, tempered by judicious firmness, were the chief secrets of this\nmarked success: and when an exigency demanded the occasional exercise of severity, punishment was confined to the\nguilty alone, and neccessary justice in all cases tempered by\nmercy. No wonder, then, that the sudden inundation of the\nCountry by a flood of adventurers, unhabituated to intercourse\nwith the native races, and whom they regarded as strangers,\ndisorganised previous restraint. But British law soon asserted\nits sway. The excesses of the evil-disposed among the immigrants were checked with the strong hand. Detected culprits\namong the natives suffered punishment under due legal process ; and thus order was restored. Subsequently it became\nnecessary to employ severe measures upon the West Coast of\nVancouver Island. One or two villages were bombarded by\nvessels of Her Majesty's Squadron, in order to compelthe\ndelivery of offenders-guilty of crimes against a ship-wrecked\nerew\u2014and a salutary dread was established in all parts along\nthe Coast, which the periodical visit of a gun-boat serves to\nmaintain and strengthen.\nIn the interior of the Mainland, where, as I have remarked,\nthe Indians are more sparsely distributed, and are altogether\na race morally superior to those of the Coast, order has been\nsuccessfully maintained by the Civil Power. The natives\n-long habituated to our customs, through intercourse with the\nformer traders, harmonise well with the present occupants;\nand- the kind treatment generally extended to them by the\nwell-disposed, secures good-will. It is in the \"Debateable\nLand\" alone, situated between the frontier of the settled\nregion of the Interior, and the main-land Coast, that any danger of collision, however remote, is to be apprehended. The\nnatives along this line, seated near the rapids which interrupt\nmm n\nINDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS^\nthe navigation of the minor rivers disemboguing along the\nCoast\u2014the points most favorable for their salmon-fisheries\u2014\nare numerous; and, owing to their seclusion, comparatively\nmore rude and uncultivated than the rest. Through this\neause, partly, and partly from causes that have never been\nsatisfactorily explained, some -eight years ago, a party of men\nin the employ of the late Mr. Waddington lost their lives near\nthe head of Bute Inlet, upon the line of road now under exploration for the Canadian-Pacific Railway: and recently a minor\nmisunderstanding has taken place at the Forks of the Skeena,\nbut unattended with loss of life or personal molestation. The\nfirst was settled by the local Government, though at great\npecuniary cost, by the punishment of the murderers.: the\nsecond, originating in the accidental burning of a village,\nthrough the negligent act of some travelling-party on their\nway to the Peace River mines, has been arranged by Governor Trutch, on the part of the Dominion Government, by\na trifling money-payment for the loss sustained\u2014an arrangement no less judicious, than equitable under the circumstances. As regards this class of the natives, however, it may\nbe hoped that, under prudent management, and with the\nknowledge of our real power that exists, all occasion for the\n\u25a0exercise of future severity will be averted.\nI have said that the former Governments of the ei-devant\nColony have been uupardonably supiae with regard to the\nIndians. I mean this relatively, as concerning their positive\nelevation in the social scale: not as inferring want of sympathy in their actual condition. For the Indians have\nalways shared, equally with the white residents, the protection of the law; and this they have been made to understand, and are fully awane of. But there is a wide field for\n\u25a0their material improvement\u2014material, indeed, but implying\na concomitant amelioration of a deeper and a holier nature;\nfor the two go hand in hand, and cannot be dissevered. I\nhave casually noticed the missionary efforts that are in pro-\n\u2022gress; and I may add that, so far as is apparent, a degree of INDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS.\n95\nUnanimity prevails, despite the formal differences of creed,\nwhich argues well for the general progress. For, admitted\nthat a common end be in view, it is surely impolitic to disturb the minds of the neophytes, by questions of whether\nthe good teaching be of Paul or of Apollos. Be not\nalarmed, however, kind reader. We are not about to enter\nupon a polemical disquisition. The point is noticed because\nwe have witnessed elsewhere the evil consequences of such\nwarfare of sect against sect, to the common detriment of all\nBut as an adjunct to moral and religious teaching, however\nzealously applied, the inculcation of solid industry, and the\nmaterial elevation of the Indian in the social scale, are elements essential to success; and where such success may have\nbeen hitherto partially obtained, it will be found that to this\ncombination of effort, mainly, it is attributable. To this\nend the co-operation and aid of the Government are an important condition : and it is satisfactory to know, that, under\nthe new relations of the Province, this co-operation will ere\nlong be afforded. The success of Mr. Duncan, the Superintendent of the Church Missionary establishment at Methla-\nk&tla before referred to, only partially fostered by the authorities as his exertions may have been, is an example of what\nmay be effected under zealous and judicious management.\nI am aware that the efforts of this gentleman have been\noccasionally scoffed at or under-rated; but every enterprise\nof the same nature has been subjected to similar detraction,\n\u2014the value of which, therefore, in this case may be readily\nestimated. My own conclusion, from information directly\nand indirectly acquired from unquestionable sources, is that\nmuch good has been already effected, and a solid groundwork laid for wide prospective improvement. Yet it is to\nbe regretted that in the conduct of this mission, admirable\nthough its success has been, a grave oversight is suffered to\ncontinue by its sustainers. Its policy is too much centered\nin an individual\u2014in many points of view an evil, and obviously in this; that, no successor being in course of pre- 9G\nINDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS.\nparation, were the present Superintendent to die to-morrow,\nthe whole edifice which he has founded with so much pains,\nwould probably crumble to the ground. Division of labor,\nso necessary in the mechanical arts,* is no less beneficial in\nmissionary enterprise.\nVarious missions have at different times been established\namong the Indians of the North-west; some of which, like\nthat just noticed, have been partially successful, while\nethers, through neglect of proper conditions, have signally\nfailed. East of the Rocky Mountains an Episcopalian Mission has been in operation on the Missimpi, or English\nRiver, which has, I understand, attained a fair measure of\nsuccess. This mission, which has existed for the last thirty\nyears, was founded aad liberally endowed under the will of\nthe late Mr. James Leith, formerly a Chief Factor of the\nHudson's Bay Company, for the special improvement of the\nnatives among whom it has been placed. Upon the Saskatchewan, and at Lake Winipeg, on my last visit to Hudh\nson's Bay, in 1842, a Wesleyan Mission had been recently\nestablished; and there were also Roman Catholic Missions\nin various parts. On the Columbia River, in the parts which\n* The importance of this axiom is notably recognised by the\nJesuits, in the admirable discipline of their missions. While regular subordination is maintained, aught approaching to a preponderating individual influence is rigidly discountenanced. All unite,\neach in his separate path, to promote the common end : and one\nleader being removed by death or other cause, another is not\nwanting to supply the deficiency. With some I may possibly incur\na degree of odium for thus instancing as an example, the proceedings of a body whom I know it is the fashion to decry. But I do\nso advisedly\u2014without reference to the remote political aspirations\nwhich its members are supposed constantly to keep in view, and\nof which I do not profess to judge\u2014but solely in accordance with\nthe beneficent results of their exertions, as missionaries, which 1\nmyself have witnessed. I may add, that I recall with satisfaction the many pleasant hours which\u2014spite of formal difference ftf-\ncreed\u2014I have enjoyed, in bygone times, in the remote recesses of\nthe interior, along the line of the Eocky Mountains, in the society\nof my worthy friends of this indefatigable Order: notably, the\nFathers Nobili, De Vos, Yercruysae, Accolti, Mingarini, and\nothers ; some of whom have since gone to their rest, while others\nstill continue their self-denying labours in various parts. m&dm\nINDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS.\n97\nby the Treaty of 1846, became portions of the United States,\nseveral missionary establishments were founded in 1840 by\nAmerican societies, and afterwards abandoned in despair of\nsuccess. One of these, howover, conducted, on the more\nsolid basis I have indicated, by the Reverend Dr. Whitman,\nsave earnest of a more favorable issue. But a sad* catastro-\nphe rudely dissipated the sanguine hopes that had been\nformed. The Measles broke out in 1847, and, fignorant or\nneglectful of the simple necessary precautions under the\ndisease, many of the natives were carried off, throughout\nthe country. Whispers of foul play and evil influence were\ninsinuated into the credulous minds of the survivors; and\ntheir animosity, once roused, was readily directed against\ntheir benefactors. A sudden attack was made, resulting in\nthe massacre of the worthy Dr. Whitman, his wife, and\nothers connected with the. Mission.*    Since this catastrophe\n* The mission station of Dr. Whitman was among the Cayooses,\nat Wailetpoo near Walla Walla in Washington Territory. There\nseems to be little doubt that the instigator to this fearful massacre\nwas one Joe Lewis, said to have been a Mormon, who subsequently\nevaded punishment by absconding to the Mountains. A curious\nexemplification of the respect in which the people of the Hudson's\nBay Company were held by the natives, was afforded on this sad\noccasion. Two boys, sons of-one of the Officers, who were under\nthe care of Dr. Whitman, for tuition, were called forth by name as\nthe massacre began, and from the very presence of the poor lady\nwho a moment after fell a victim. They were taken charge of by\nthe chief, and sent on horseback, under escort, to the adjacent\npost of the Company at Walla Walla. Subsequently the late Chief\nFactor Peter Skeen Ogden, who with the present Sir James Douglas\nat that time superintended the affairs of the Columbia Department,\nransomed from the Indians, and thus probably saved the lives, of\na number of American immigrants who had been made captives.\nIt is of interest, however, to notice how all these matters dovetail with each other. The existence of British Columbia as a Colony\u2014an event that sooner or later must of course have occurred\u2014\nwas directly hastened by the event related. Debarred for the time\nfrom our usual access to the sea, by the Columbia Eiver, through\nthe war that existed between the American Government and the\nIndians\u2014known locally as the Cayoose War\u2014we were compelled,\nin 1848, to force our way to the Coast by the line of the Fraser, in\norder to import the annual supplies for the Interior. Fortunately,\nas if by prophetic anticipation, routes in this direction had been\nexplored during the summers of 1846 and 1847. By one of these,\nstriking the Fraser at the point above Yale where the Alexandra\nmSem!, Jp%\n98\nINDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS\nall missionary enterprise, upon the line of the Columbia\nRiver, has, I believe, been confined to the Roman Catholics.\nOn the Pend' oreille tributary, near the Boundary Line, a\nJesuit mission has been in operation for many years,\nthrough which much good has been effected\u2014a system of\ncommon-labour, under established rules, being partly the\nfoundation of success. As far back as 1842, the late Right\nReverend Bishop ^Demers\u2014then a priest, and afterwards\nR. C. Bishop of the Diocese \u2014 passed a winter under the\nwriter's roof at Alexandria, where a rude church was erected *\nunder his supervision by the natives: and at present, at different points there are mission-stations conducted by clergy\nof the various denominations, whose labours, it may be\nhoped, are more or less encouraged by success.\nI have thought it proper, even at the risk of being tedious,\nto dwell at some length upon this topic, in order to dispel\nthe impression that appears to have gone abroad, that j,he\nNatives of British Columbia are in a condition of unmitigated\nbarbarism\u2014than which no statement can be more fallacious.\nThat the large majority of the Coast Indians are, morally, in\na very degraded condition, may not be concealed: but there\nis nothing in their conduct to justify the fabulous tales of wanton blood-thirst, as against the whites, that have been lately\npromulgated. Thievish, and deplorably licentious in their\nhabits, as they doubtless are, they have been over-awed by\nthe law; and the seeds, at least, of moral improvement\u2014\ntardy and remote though the growth may be, and impeded\nby the corruptions promoted by the lower grades of the\ncivilized race\u2014have been cast among them. Nor let this\nconsideration be received with sneering incredulity. Precept\nand example are never without effect, albeit slow, and at first\nimperceptible.   The Good is perceived : and though, as with\nBridge now spans the river, we succeeded in penetrating to the\ndepot at Fort Langley\u2014and thenceforward, at first by this route\nand subsequently by the way of Hope and the valley of the Simil-\nRameen, the transport continued to be performed\u2014the prelude to\nthe great lines of communication which have since been perfected. INDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS.\n99\nthe heathen Poet of old, it may not at once be practised, the\nleaven has been introduced which, with time, must operate.\nUpon the superior character of the Interior tribes I have\nalready remarked, and need not expatiate. Yet even to\nthese, in common with the others, the most groundless\ncharges have been applied\u2014even to that of cannibalism, if we\nmay judge from the reviewer's comments. The revolting\ncharge may be unhesitatingly contradicted : the \" brave and\nblood-thirsty cannibal,\" the bug-bear held out to \" unfortunate stray settlers,\" does not exist here. The only instance\nthat-might in any way countenance the shameful accusation\nthat I ever knew, took place, or was reported, to have taken\nplace, many years ago at Fort George, in the remote interior;\nwhere an Indian, whose name I have forgotten, was said to\nhave had recourse to the horrible expedient, to save life\nwhile starving in the mountains. The Indian thus accused,\nhowever, was regarded as a kind of pariah by the rest; and\nby the voyageurs, with a pious horror, was designated the\nMangeur de monde, and scrupulously shunned. Other eases\nmay possibly have occurred, under similar circumstances;\nbut this is the only one that, ever came under my individual\nnotice\u2014and I have witnessed at times, and sometimes haply\nhad it in my power to alleviate, miseries of famine which,\nif aught might questionably excuse the revolting expedient,\nmight indeed have justified it. But, for the honor of human\nnature- in its primitive state, I am proud to say the vile\ntemptation was resisted, with a persistency of physical endurance which, witness the records of history, is not too strongly\ncharacteristic of our own boasted civilization.\nNevertheless, there was formerly a superstitious custom\namong the natives of the Coast, not yet, possibly, quite extinct in parts, which, under an exaggerated or malevolent view,\nmight be urged to countenance the. charge. This custom is\nanalogous in character, if not identical with, a practice of\nwhich we read, whether fabulously or not I do not profess to\ndetermine, as having existed among certain European na- 100\nINDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS.\ntions\u2014the Lycanthropia of the Ancients, the Loup-garou of\nFrance, the Persian Ghoule, the Teutonic Wehr-wolj\u2014all,\nprobably, the result of a simulated ecstacy of superstitious .\norigin, resolving itself, at times, into-a real phrensy. In the\ncase immediately referred to the object was to constitute\npower as | a Man of Medicine \"\u2014equivalent to the African\nfetish, or the like. In the Southern parts of Vancouver\nIsland this assumed wolf-madness took the shape of tearing\nliving dogs to pieces with the teeth; among the Bella-bellas\nof Milbank Sound of biting pieces of flesh from the arms of\nthe unresisting bystanders during the progress of the rites;\nand farther North, as I have been assured but never myself\nwitnessed, of tearing to pieces and even partially devouring\na sacrificed slave. Revolting as the statement may appear,\nit Will be estimated at its full value, if employed to sustain\na charge which, ignorantly or presumptuously advanced, has\nbeen only too credulously accepted.\nThe difference to which I have several times adverted as\nexisting between the natives of the Interior districts and the\noccupants of the Coast, in customs, character, and language,\nindicates unmistakably a diversity of origin. The natives\nof what I have termed the \"Debatable Land\"\u2014those occupying the line intermediate between the Coast and the\nInterior\u2014are obviously of mixed extraction through intermarriage, and participate in the characteristics of both races.\nIt is, however, aside from my purpose to enter into particulars regarding this question, which is one rather for the.\nethnologist than the general enquirer. Nevertheless, as\nregards the several tribes that fringe the Northern Coast of\nthe Continent, from the borders of California up to Cook's\nInlet, where they interlock with the Western Esquimaux, I\nmay state the conclusion at which we may, I think legitimately arrive : namely, that they originate from the west-\nWaid\u2014from Japan, the Kuriles, and elsewhere. There are\nmany points of physical resemblance, with probably remote\ntraces, of customs, which indicate the origin of some of them,\n\\YXaa\u00a3 INDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS.\n101\nat least, from Japan. Whether the immigration in the remote past has been voluntary or fortuitous, it is of course\nvain to conjecture : but the possibility of the latter supposition has been convincingly established, even within the limit\nof my own experience. For in 1834, in consequence of\nIndian rumours which had reached the Columbia River\nduring the preceding winter, a vessel was despatched from\nFort Vancouver to Queen-hfi-ilth,* south of Cape Flattery,\nto enquire into the circumstances of a reported wreck.\nCaptain McNeill, the Commander, on arriving there, found the\nremnants of a Japanese junk, and purchased from the natives\na quantity of pottery and other articles that had formed portions of her cargo. He likewise brought away three Japanese,\nthe survivors of a crew originally consisting, as we understood, of forty; the rest having perished at sea, of hunger.\nIt appeared that, having been dismasted in a typhoon and\nlost their reckoning, the junk had drifted for many months\nuntil at length stranded. Since then frequent mention has\nbeen made of disabled junks having been encountered at sea\nin the North Pacific, by whalers, and the survivors of the\ncrews rescued from their perilous condition. All these were\nmore or less advanced in their drift towards the American\nContinent. On board one of them was found, among other\nmerchandise, about 12,000 pounds of Beeswax. This cir*\ncumstance affords the clue whereby the nationality of another\njunk wrecked long ago upon the Coast, near the mouth of\nthe Columbia River, can be inferentially established. A\ntradition of this existed when the first traders settled there\nin 1810; and some of the crew were said to have reached the\nshore alive. ' This tradition, however, derived direct corroboration from the fact, that quantities of beeswax were constantly found in the sands at Clatsap, on the southern shore\nof the estuary\u2014the indicated point of shipwreck. As late\nas 1855, indeed, after violent storms, cakes of the wax, re-\n* This, or its immediate vicinity, was the scene of the destruction\nof the \" Tonquin,\" and massacre of the crew, in 1811. See Fran-\nchare's travels, and Astoria, by Washington Irving,\n. \u2022 .._      vdT\nm?\\ lOi\nINDIANS AND INDIAN MISSIONS.\ntaining their original form and quite uncorroded by time,\nwere still occasionally discovered\u2014the sole difference observable between it and the recent substance being, that it was\nofa finer quality; harder, and partially bleached by exposure.*\nWithal, the race has greatly diminished in numbers since\ntheir contact with Europeans. One tribe, the Chinooks of\nthe Lower Columbia River,\u2014numerous when first I knew\nthem,\u2014has almost entirely vanished : and along the Northern Coast a constant diminition is perceptible, more especially\namong those who have immediate intercourse with the\nWhites. For this, divers obvious causes may be assigned.\nThe occasional devastation by epidemics, such as small-pox,\nis one: of this last-mentioned disease, however, the spread\nhas been much diminished of late by vaccination. A second\nfertile cause has been, doubtless, the supply of intoxicating\nliquors\u2014deleterious if not positively poisonous compounds\u2014\nby unscrupulous men of the lowest and the laziest class. The\nlaws established for the prevention of this offence, both\nwithin the Province and in the adjacent Territory of the\nUnited States, are stringent, and every effort is made to\nenforce them: nevertheless constant evasions occur; and it\nhas been seriously mooted whether, if it be found impracticable to suppress the nefarious traffic entirely, it might not\nbe prudent to legalise it under due restrictions. Upon this\nvexed question I am not called upon at present to advance\nan opinion. It will doubtless soon come under the notice of\nthe Federal Government; and be decided either in the way\nproposed, or by the adoption of suppressive measures more\ncogent in their character, and more efficiently carried out,\nthan those at present in operation. A third and last cause\nmay be only passingly adverted to: the physical contamination which a degraded and licentious intercourse carries with\nit, against which no laws can provide. Yet, even among\nsome of the interior races, and while still their communi-\ntion with the Whites was very limited, a mysterious decay\nwas apparent, referrible to none of the causes mentioned.\n* See Appendix H-2. STATE OF SOCIETY.\n103\nPulmonary affections were the form in which the decay of\nthe vital power was manifested in the children: and each\nsuccessive generation showed a greater ratio of deaths,\nchiefly of confirmed phthisis. A great change in the ordinary habits of life might be suggested as the most obvious\ncause of this degeneration. The substitution, among many,\nof European clothing for the primitive dress of skins, alternated at times with unwonted exposure through uncertainty\nof supply, might well induce, in part, the effect noted. But,\nwhile noting the general effect that has resulted, it is bootless\nto speculate too narrowly as to the cause.\nIt may possibly be considered by some, that I have dwelt\nwith too much minuteness upon the subject of which we will\nnow take leave. But its importance in considering the condition of the Province is, I trust, an adequate excuse. The\namelioration of the native race, moreover, is a proposition\nnot to be lightly ignored. While asserting for ourselves the\nprivileges of civilization, we assume also its responsibilities :\nand whether in our relations as a Government, or as individuals, it is necessary that these responsibilities should be kept\nin view.\nThe question of the general condition of society within\nthe Province has been very summarily dismissed in the text.\nI might here repeat emphatically the expressions already\nused, and thus convey the only contradiction which I might\ncondescend to give to the disparaging insinuations which\nhave been published. But I am not to constitute myself the\napologist of the British Columbians against every absurd\nattack; and they would, indeed, be little thankful to me for\nthe exercise of a chivalry so superfluous. I will confine\nmyself, therefore, to a brief notice of some of the circumstances that have contributed to the establishment in this\nyoung community, of a degree of order and respect for the\nlaw, which among eye-witnesses has excited general admiration. In 1858, as I have before casually mentioned, Victoria 104\nSTATE OF SOCIETY,\nwas suddenly awakened from a previous trance by the influx\nof successive crowds of eager immigrants, attracted by the\nreport of the gold-discoveries on the Fraser. A vast and\nmotley assemblage was soon collected in the hitherto tranquil\nvicinage. How many there really may have been cannot be\ncorrectly estimated. I have set the number down vaguely at\n20 or 30 thousand\u2014there were probably more : and among\nthem, it is needless to add, there was no small proportion of\nturbulent characters, each armed with his bowie-knife or his\nrevolver, and generally disposed to set the restraints of the law\nat defiance. Into this crowd of desperadoes the constable\u2014\nfor primitive Victoria boasted, I believe, but of one\u2014proceeded to arrest an offender. No personal injury was done to the\nminion of the law, but as a matter of course his prisoner was'\nrescued by the surrounders. Governor Douglas, receiving\nnotice of this occurrence late in the evening, at once despatched\na message to Captain\u2014the present Admiral\u2014Richards, then\nat Esquimalt in command of H.M.S. Plumper. In Jess than an\nhour after the receipt of the Governor's message, the Plumper\nsteamed into Victoria Harbour. The marines were landed, and,\nafter a very brief interval of search, the rescued prisoner was\nre-arrested by the Civil arm, and before midnight was safely\nlodged in the bastion of the old Fort\u2014the prison of the period.\nThe firm, yet quiet, assertion of the law on this occasion had\nat once a salutary effect. Afterwards, when the machinery\nfor maintaining public order was fully organised, all difficulties gradually disappeared. I might here pay a tribute of\nacknowledgment, personal to those who have been instrumental in carrying out the laws; but good taste warns me to\nrefrain. Yet I may safely say, that to the unflinching rigour\nof the juduciary, and the energy of the stipendiary magistracy,\nthe good results are mainly due : and I may add that the\ngood sense and law-abiding sentiment of the majority of the\npopulation, have co-operated to the desirable end. No extreme\nmeasures, such as the exigencies of society have at times demanded  elsewhere, have   here   been   requisite.      Ail   has CAUSES OF PAST RETARDATION.\n105\nbeen conducted with an order and a propriety such as\none might expect to witness in an older country; and although a sprinkling of bad characters may still remain,\nthe majority find it expedient to quit a scene where their evil\ndeeds cannot be exercised openly with impunity. The good\nunderstanding, too, which has always existed between the\nlocal Government and the United States authorities, our neighbours\u2014with the Ex-tradition Treaty and the facilities afforded\nby the electric telegraph\u2014has aided reciprocally in promoting\nthe maintenance of order in both communities. I am glad to\nhave the opportunity of referring incidentally to the existence\nof this friendly understanding, which no circumstances have\noccurred to interrupt; and which, with the constant inter-\n'communication that subsists, is in all respects mutually beneficial. \t\nAt the outset of his comments on the statements upon which\nhe professes to found a judgment, the reviewer remarks that\nno country has so signally disappointed expectation as British\nColumbia. What the sanguine expectations formed may possibly have been, it is needless to inquire; but as far as the\ngold-yield alone is concerned, the recorded returns for the\nlast fourteen years elsewhere given\u2014equal to an average of\n\u00a380 sterling per annum for every individual of the present\nEuropean population\u2014do not surely justify the assertion.\nWithal, we may admit, generally, that just expectations have\nnot been adequately fulfilled : and for this reasons may be\nassigned. In the first place the marvellous policy of the Imperial Rulers in placing the two sections which compose the\nthe present Province under distinct governments, as separate\nColonies, was directly impeditive of success. The puerile\njealousies hence engendered, moreover, continued to exercise a\nbaneful influence, even after the cause whence they originated\nhad been removed. A retrograde step is not readily recovered : and albeit that a reactive movement had begun\nto be manifested after awhile, it was not until a new\nimpetus had been given by Confederation that positive im- 106\nGENERAL PROGRESS ON THE PACIFIC COAST.\nprovement became a reality. The liberal terms of union agreed\nupon, and the energetic measures to fulfil them since pursued\nby the Administration, have restored that confidence in our\nfuture which had before^been shaken. Meanwhile evil reports\nhad been spread abroad, either from interested motives, or by\ndisappointed speculators, who abused the land in order to\nscreen their own want of energy or misconduct. Books, too,\nof a certain class, were written with a view to the mercenary\npenny; and these were seasoned with all manner of exaggeration and mis-statement, in order the better to sell. Yet no\npublic steps were taken to counteract the misrepresentation ;\nand if any one at a distance learnt possibly aught of the truth\nabout the Country, it was by accident rather than of design.-'\nEven our Gold, large as the yield has been, has never been\ncredited, in the public records to British Columbia. Shipped\nhence to San Francisco, on its way Eastward, it is re-shipped\nthence, and reaches England ostensibly as the return of Cali-\nifornia. So, too, with our noble spars : Oregon Spars have\nlong had a reputation in the European markets : and because\nBritish Columbia happens to be near to Oregon (or rather to\nthat division of it now called Washington Territory) her spars\nreach England as \" Oregon Spars.\"* In short, save to the\nfavoured few, British Columbia seems to stand almost in the\nposition of an unknown land. The great majority, if asked,\nwould probably assign it a place \" somewhere between the\nEquator and the North Pole,\" and there end the geographical\ndefinition.\nYet wherefore complain of this flagrant ignorance regarding\nour own comparatively insignificant Province\u2014insignificant,\nthat is, save prospectively\u2014when even the vast resources of\nCalifornia are scarcely recognised ? Few, outside of the mercantile world or the circle of well-read students, realise to\nthemselves the fact that San Francisco\u2014a paltry village\ntwenty-five years ago,\u2014is now a city of maritime importance\n* Of this fact an amusing illustration recently appeared in one\nof the local prints.\ntifrmi EXTENT AND COST OF EXISTING RAILWAYS.\n107\nequal to that of many famed sea-ports of the Old World\u2014the\nmercantile capital of a State of surpassing opulence.   In direct\nconnexion with it,  extending- northwards,  are the thriving\ncommunities of Oregon\u2014itself an opulent State; the Territory\nof Washington; and last, if not least in importance, British\nColumbia.*    To show the large interests developed in these\nStates on the Pacific slope, if not to gratify the curiosity of the\nreader, the following statement, taken from a recent Oregon\nnewspaper, may not be without interest, nor irrelevant to the\ngeneral question.\n\" According to the latest reports, we now have 2,239 miles\nof railroad on the Pacific Coast, constructed and equipped at a\ncost of $174,322,000, as follows :\u2014\nMiles Cost and\ncompleted.

The tree (Abies Douglasii,* or Douglas Fir of\nLindley) already referred to, which produces the material so\nvaluable among our Provincial industries, is peculiar to the\nnorthern portion of Oregon, to Washington Territory, and the\ngreater portion of British Columbia. It is, however, only in\nthe Coast region that it attains gigantic.proportions: elsewhere\nit is comparatively small. Stray specimens are found as high as\nbetween five and six thousand feet above the sea-level; but\nthese are stunted and scrubby.\\ In the Appendix will be\nfound tables illustrative of the tenacity of fibre and flexibility\nof this now-celebrated timber, as compared with other similar\nwoods; \u00a7 and I subjoin a memorandum with which I have\nbeen recently favoured of the dimensions of the spars usually\nprepared for the several markets.\nFor the French Government masts of very large size are\ndemanded, varying from 22 ins. to 44 ins. in diameter: for\nthe English market, generally from 34 ins. down to 11 ins.\nIn both cases they are dressed octagonally for shipment.\nThose from 24 inches downwards, intended for yards, are\n* Named by Dr. Lindley in honor of the late David Douglas\u2014a\nname too well-known in scientific circles, in connexion with the\nbotany of the North-west Coast, to require more than mention.\nPoor Douglas, after passing some years in the Columbia, at the\nForts of the Hudson's Bay Company, went to the Sandwich Islands,\nand lost his life Hawaii.

An unfortunate ambiguity in the wording of the Treaty of 1846,\nusually called the Oregon Treaty, has, however, led to an\ninternational dispute as to what interpretation is to be put\nupon the meaning of the framers, by the term \" dividing\nchannel\"; the British having always understood thereby the\nPfcOsario Strait, the only ship-channel navigated at the time; 110\nSAN JUAN.QUESTION.\nthe United States contending, more recently, for that since\nsurveyed, and now known to be practicable, called the Strait\nof Arro\u2014immediately contiguous to  the  main  island  of\nVancouver.    In 1859 the dispute came to a crisis;  the\nAmerican General in command in Oregon having landed a\nmilitary force and thus claimtd their asserted rights.    At\nfirst the matter wore rather a threatening aspect for the\ninternational peace.    The prudence of the British Admiral\non the station, Sir Robert L. Baynes, however, prevented a\ncollision, which the proceeding was only too well calculated to\nprovoke.    A Company of the Royal Marine Light Infantry\nwas landed at another point in assertion of the British claim.\nSubsequently the disavowal by the American Government of\nthe action of their General, and his removal from the command, remedied to some extent the soreness that was at first\nexperienced.    Since then, by joint' consent, both parties\nhave maintained the occupation;   and it is  gratifying  to\nknow that the relations between the rival commands have\nbeen invariably of the most cordial nature.    This strange\ncondition of things, however, is about to terminate.    By the\nTreaty of Washington of 1870 the case has been referred\nfor arbitration to the Emperor of Germany, whose decision\nmay be shortly expected.    In pursuance of this subject I\nneed only quote the following words from a recent speech of\nthe Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald.\n\" That [the San Juan question] is settled in a way that no\none can object to.    I do not know whether many honorable\nmembers have ever studied that question.    It is a most\ninteresting one, and has long been a cause of controversy\nbetween the two countries.     I am bound to uphold, and I\ndo uphold, the British view respecting the channel which\nforms the boundary, as the correct one.    The United States\nGovernment were, I believe, -as sincerely convinced of their\nown case.   Both believed they were in the right, both were\nfirmly grounded in that opinion; and such being the case\nthere was only one way of it, and that was to leave it to be END.\nIll\nsettled by impartial arbitration. ***************\nWhatever the decision may be\u2014whether for England or\nagainst her\u2014you may be satisfied that you will get a most\nlearned and careful judgment in the matter, to which we\nmust bow if it is against us, and to which I am sure the\nUnited States will bow if it is against them.\"* Here, then*\nthe matter stands, pending the Emperor's decision.\nThe writer must conclude with a personal explanation\u2014\nat no time a graceful act, but which under . the circumstances seems inevitable. The distant reader, for whom\nalone such explanation will be necessary, may possibly enquire as to the conditions which justify the writer in advancing, at times, unqualified opinions upon certain subjects\nto render which of authentic value, long experience, and\npeculiar opportunities for observation, must be pre-established. To forestal all probable conjecture on this point\nhe may at once state, that since his youth, for the last forty\nyears\u2014more than two-thirds of his life-time\u2014he has been a\nsojourner in various parts within the vast angle included by\nthe Columbia River, and the Rocky Mountains: first as a\nClerk, then as a Chief-Trader and Wintering-Partner, of the\nHudson's Bay Company under the old regime; and afterwards as a rather unsettled \" settler\"\u2014till for some years\npast near Victoria, where he is now, probably, permanently\nat home. Thus there are few nooks, within the area in\nquestiou, which he has not either visited in person, or of\nwhich he has not indirectly acquired a knowledge. In\ntreating the subject the retrospect has been at times a painful\none: for if, as may be imagined, during the earlier period\n* Speech  of Sir John A.

Yale,\nEsquire, formerly of the Hudson's Bay Company, relating\nto the Fraser River Salmon.\n\" I believe, and think it may be asserted as a fact, that none of\nthe several kinds of Salmon, including Hones, entering Fraser\nRiver and the smaller streams, ever return to the sea. The large\nand superior kind called by the natives Sa-quy [Kase of the text)\nenter the river in May or June, but do not, it would seem, make so\ngreat a rush to reach the end of their course as the smaller kind,\ncalled by the Quaitlins Suck-ky (Tdlo of the text). This species\nenter the river generally about the beginning of July, and are followed in September, some seasons earlier, by the Sa-wen (Fall\nSalmon), paler in color of flesh and somewhat larger than the\nSuck-ky. When taken in season they are found to be an excellent\n\u25a0fish. With these come, late in autumn, a few of large size called\nPaque, differing from the Sa-quy only in their flesh being whiter,\nhead smaller, and body broader in proportion. Another white-\nfleshed fish called Qua-lo, having the external parts broadly striped\nor barred with a pale yellowish green and a dark brown color,\nsome years enter Fraser River in great plenty, and are nearly equal\nin size to the Sa-quy. They have more the resemblance of the\nother Salmon, and are a better flavored fish than the Hunnuns (or\nHones).\"\nMr. Tale, the writer of the above remarks, wa3 for many years\nin command at Fort Langley, near the entrance of Fraser River,\nand had therefore peculiar opportunities for observation, as regarded the Lower River.\nAPPENDIX B.\nExports from Alberni, Barclay Sound, in the year 1862.\nRough Lumber, 7,804,000 feet  $85,844 00\nDressed   do. 270,000 feet       5,400 CO\nFour cargoes Spars, value     28,673 00\nOil, 5,000 gallons @ 40 cents       2,000 00\nFurs and Skins      1,000 00\n$122,917 00\nThe working of these mills has since been suspended.\nrfattSl 11.

The\nfact itself is calculated to arouse a people accustomed to think of\nthe country as non-progressive,\u2014standing stock still. A coach\nroad from Cache Creek to Okinagan.! and a weekly line of stages\non it I ! This leads to enquiry about the country seemingly so\nsuddenly opened up. And here we are made to feel our ignorance,\n\u2014the little that is known about \"the great interior.\" We will\ntell the reader what little we know about the country penetrated\nrhTrrir\n*! XX1T.\nAPPENDIX.\nby. Mr. Barnard's enterprise. From Cache Creek to Okinagan, a\ndistance of about one hundred miles, [150] as the crow flies, six\nthousand head of cattle fatten upon nature's rich pastures. There\nis room for more than double that number. Calculating seven\nhundred pounds of beef to each animal, a low average as beeves go\nin that section, that would yield eight and a half million pounds\nof the finest beef in the world. In 1871 the yield of grain on the\nTranquille, North and South Forks of the Thompson amounted to\none and a quaiter million pounds. That was the product of less\nthan a tenth of the land held under pre-emption, the whole being\nseven thousand, six hundred and eighty acres, which should be\ncapable of producing at least twelve million pounds. Of bacon,\nupwards of forty thousand pounds was cured. At one dairy, (Mr.\nJones') two thousand, five hundred pounds of excellent butter was\nmade. The Spellum-cheen Valley will produce fall wheat of the\nfinest quality without, irrigation, in consequence of a fine surface\nsoil and clay subsoil. The Okinagan will yield only fall wheat\nwithout irrigation ; spring wheat, oats, and barley, etc., in wonderful profusion with irrigation. The yield of wheat ranges from\none and a quarter to one and a half tons per acre; As high as nine\ntons of potatoes has been taken from the acre. Wherever tried\nfruit trees have done exceedingly well, while those severer tests of\nclimate, Indian corn, tomatoes, musk melons, water melons, and\neven the grape vine have been cultivated with great success and\nwithout having recourse to artificial expedients. The country is,\nfor the most part open, dotted with trees giving it almost the\nappearance of an old country park. It is so free from wood as to\nenable the horseman to canter at will in almost every direction,\nand in some instances no obstructions are presented to the free\nprogress of a carriage. The face of the country is beautiful\u2014\nrelieved by ever changing succession of hill and dale. The water\nsystem is excellent, the surface of the country being indented by\nnumerous lakes and rivers or smaller streams, everywhere\nteeming with fish of excellent quality. A mild climate will\nhave already been inferred. It may be added that snow seldom\nfalls to any depth, and never lies long. Horses, horned cattle\nand sheep pass the winter unhoused and uncared for and, as\na rule, -come out in good condition in the spring. On most\nof the grass ranges cattle shifting for themselves through winter\nare in prime condition for beef in the spring. In the country thus\nroughly and very imperfectly sketched, there are a few hundred\nsettlers\u2014we really do not know how many. In the valleys of the\nThompson, Okinagan, und Cache Creek., there are about one hundred children. There is the making of happy homes for tens of\nthousands. In truth no more desirable country can be found, and\nit is not unreasonable to hope that the opening of a coach road\nleading through the heart of it, and the facilities for travel presented by a weekly line of stages may lead persons in search of\nhomes to go and see for themselves. The impression has gone\nforth that British Columbia is not, and can never be, an agricultural\ncountry. Without pausing to discuss the proper definition of the\nterm, we will say, without fear of successful contradiction, that,\nalthough British Columbia may never become a large exporter of\nagricultural productions, she has at least within herself the means\nIk .*\u00bb. mm$m\nAPPENDIX.\nXXV\nof supporting a population of between two and three millions.\nThis much may safely be said in respect of what is known.

These hops resemble the California, and would be equally\nsure to find ready sale in this or other markets at the highest rates;\nthey have been well dried and are in first rate condition.\n*\" Our estimate of the value of these hops is that they are worth\nfully 10 cents per pound more than the best Canadian growth, the\nprices of which, during the past season, ranged from 50 to 75\ncents per pound according to demand. Exceptionally high prices,\nhowever.    Yours faithfully, WM.

The consumption of Sugar (except refined) is met almost\nentirely by importations direct from the Sandwich Islands\u2014the\nquality very superior. From the same source there is also a considerable importation of other produce, including Oranges, Bananas\nand other semi-tropical fruits. The chief supply of flour has\nhitherto been from Oregon ; but in the Interior a sufficiency is\nnow manufactured to meet the local demand, or nearly so, the Indian\npopulation being great consumers. From San Francisco, among\nother productions, are imported Oranges, Grapes, &c, in great\nprofusion during their season, together with native wines of very\ngood quality.    Other foreign wines, since the reduction of the XXV111.\nAPPENDIX.\nhigh duty till recently imposed, are procurable at a moderate\nadvance for the importer's profit.

Amateur theatricals and concerts are occasionally performed for the promotion of special objects: and among\nits other utilities, the Theatre is frequently the arena or Public\nMeetings, when of course much fervid eloquence \" splits the ears\nof tbe groundlings.\"\nAPPENDIX Y.\nQas and Witter.\nVictoria Is adequately supplied with the former by a Company\nincorporated for the purpose; and with water, by pipes laid down\nby smother Company, supplemented by cam\u2014the source of supply\nbeing certain springs on a ridge near tbe town.

The Vancouver Coal Company are opening up the\nNanaimo Mines very extensively. Douglas Pit, a largely productive mine, is still competent to, and*for the most part does, supply\npresent demand. But, in anticipation of increased' demand,\nworks are being rapidly developed at various other points. The\ndeep pit, three hundred feet below the surface, will win several\nsquare miles of coal. Workmen have only just commenced to\ndrive out from the bottom of this shaft and are crossing -what in\nmining parlance is termed a \" fault,\" which has somewhat dislocated the strata immediatelv above and below the scam. But the\ncoal, although contorted considerably, is of excellent quality; and\nindications are met with only a few feet from the pit bottom showing that the termination of the \" fault\" cannot be far off. The\nseam is from six to eight feet in thickness, and will continue to\nturn out the \" Black Diamond\" for an indefinite period. On Newcastle Island the same Company have a splendid prospect. Here\nthere are two seams being-worked into,\u2014the one known as Newcastle, the other the Douglas. Both of these seams crop out near\nthe water's edge, and are in every respect just as conveniently\nsituated for working and shipping as one could well conceive or\nwish a coal mine to be. Newcastle seam is from eight to nine feet\nin thickness, and a \" heading \" is driven into it two hundred and\nfifty yards by way of exploration. This mine is fully ready to yield\na regular out-put of excellent coal: The Douglas seam is explored\nbji^lope two hundred and seventy yards from the surface, the coal\nimproving in thickness as the depth increases.- At the bottom of\nthe slope, the formation is divided into two parts,\u2014thus : three\nand a half feet of coal, and two and a half feet of indurated clay,\nand over the clay there are three feet of coal. As the slope deepens,\nthe fire-clay grows thinner, and experienced miners argue confidently, from this gradual convergence of the two seams of coal,\nthat they will be found to join not far off. There appears to be no\nreasonable ground of doubt as to the extent and continuity of these.\nIsland coals, as both seams are found in proper position on both\nsides of the Island.     Wharf accomodation, and the best and most\njm is?\nAPPENDIX.\nXXXlll.\ncomplete appliances and facilities for shipping the coal are being\nprojected and provided as fast as the works can be proceeded with.\nOther explorations for deep coal are about to be made. It will be\nimpossible to dwell upon the very complete, substantial, and\nextensive character of the Company's Works and machinery.\nThese might well occupy an entire article. Were we to stop here,\nthe reader would receive a very inadequate impression as to the\nextent of the coal measures at Nanaimo, and the amount of enterprise applied to their development. The Wellington Coal Mine\n(perhaps more generally known as the Dunsmuir Mine) on Departure Bay, about three miles above the town of Nanaimo, must not\nbe accounted as amongst the least important of our coal workings.\nHere the indomitable perseverance of Mr. Dunsmuir was rewarded\nby finding a seam of very superior coal, having a thickness ranging from eight to thirteen feet; and in a position highly favorable\nto profitable development. This mine is about three miles distant\nfrom the point of shipment on Departure Bay and has been\nworked for more than a twelvemonth. A very substantial wooden\ntramway has been constructed from the mine to the water, where\nlarge and commodious wharves have been built. At present the\ncoal is transported in trams drawn by horses; but the enterprising\nmanager has resolved that in the. course of another year the\nwooden rail shall be superseded by the iron, and the horse by the\nlocomotive steam engine. This cursory and necessarily very incomplete sketch may suffice to show that'British Columbia possesses great coal stores and that she is not altogether unprepared\nto meet the greatly increased demand almost certain very soon to\nbe made upon these stores. It also points to the great importance\nof Nanaimo, the Newcastle of the Dominion.\"\u2014British Colonist,\nAugust 15th, 1872.\nAPPENDIX C-2.\nNotes regarding the Stone-quarry at Nanaimo.    From the\n\" British Colonist\" newspaper\u2014August, 1872.\n'' Nanaimo is endowed with greater natural wealth than, perhaps, any other part of the wide Dominion of Canada. Her coal\nmeasures already opened formed the subject of a recent article.\nHer coal stores still locked might fill a book. In these practio^ily\ninexhaustible stores Nanaimo possesses a power which must compel Commerce and Manufacture to kneel at her feet. But Nanaimo\nhas a mine of wealth of a different kind\u2014the Newcastle Stone\nQuarry. This quarry has been worked for upwards of two years,\nand yet it may be said to be scarcely opened. Here are several\nsquare miles of a continuous formation of the best free-stone to\nbe found anywhere on the coast. No more conclusive evidence of\nthe superiority of this stone need be sought than the fact that the\nUnited States Mint at San Francisco is made of it. The mint cost\nconsiderably over a million and a half, and absorbed eight thousand\nmm XXXIV.\nAPPENDIX.\ntons of the Newcastle stone. The introduction of this stone for\nso important a purpose naturally aroused a certain amount of\nlocal jealousy and brought out some international prejudice. The\nconsequence was that the stone was subjected to a rather more\nsevere test than would otherwise have been the case. It is gratifying to learn that the United States Inspector has, in his recent final\nreport, given the stone the highest character. To possess a stone\nquarry so superior in every respect as to command the patronage\nof San Francisco and overcome the prejudices of the Great Republic is something of which Nanaimo may justly be proud. We\nhave said that the San Francisco Mint took eight thousand tons of\nthis stone. In addition to this it took a large quantity of flagging-\nstone for court-yard, side-walks, and cellar. In the eight thousand\ntons were some pieces deserving of specific notice. There were\nsix columns, twenty-eight feet long, by four feet two inches square.\nThese columns were faultless throughout. There were two stones\nfor corner pediment fifteen tons each, and two key stones of fourteen tons each. One circumstance has tended seriously to lessen\nthe profits of the quarry. Every stone going to make up the\neight thousand tons for the mint has been of specific dimensions;\nand in quarrying to fill the order a great deal of such stone as\nwould be used for smaller buildings or for rubble masonry has\ngone to waste owing to there being no demand for it. Of this\nwaste stone there has been enough to realize fifty thousand dollars\nin a market presenting a local demand for it. And yet it has not\nyielded fifty cents. Nay, to remove it out of the way has cost\nthousands of dollars. We have said that the quarry is scarcely\nfairly opened. The last cargo of stone sent to San Francisco has\nbeen pronounced of a superior quality to that previously sent. It\nis well understood that the quality of the stone improves as yon\ngo in. The quarry has now an excellent and carefully prepared\n\" face\" on it, from which stone may be taken superior in point of\nquality to any yet quarried, and of almost any conceivable dimensions. Columns fifty feet long (or one hundred if necessary) by\nfour and a half feet thick can be supplied, without flaw or fault\nin them; or if necessary, blocks fifteen feet square can be taken\nout. This quarry is doubtless destined to exert more or less influence upon the character of our public buildings. Amongst\nother things the Federal Government have undertaken to erect a\nCustom-house, Post-office, Penitentiary, and Marine Hospital in\nthis Province. It is of no little importance that the Newcastle\nQuarry, so convenient and accessible for shipping, stands prepared\nto sunply the necessary stone for these; and the facilities thus\npresented for obtaining the larger sections of the finest stone will\ndoubtless encourage the Dominion Government to indulge in a\nclass of architecture that might be considered unattainable under\nless auspicious circumstances. When the United States authorities have sent all the way to Nanaimo for stone to construct the\nmint at San Francisco, the Dominion Government cannot well entertain the idea of employing less desirable material in the construction of the Federal buildings here. Persons visiting Nanaimo\nshould not come away without \"doing\" Newcastle Quarry. A\nvisit to it will repay the trouble, and will always bo rendered en- *?&;.\nAPPENDIX.\nXXXV.\njoyable by the kind hospitality and courteous attentions of the\ndeservedly popular proprietor, J. G.

Signed, L. A. Sylvester, Du\nPerron. Chief Engineer of 3d Section.\nThe following from an Essay by the Rev. R. C. L. Brown.\nThe following extract from the Gardener's Chronicle, is given by\na recent number of the British Columbian newspaper:\n\"The remarks lately made in our columns on the very great\nvalue of the Douglas fib, have led one of the most skilful of our\njudges of timber to favour us with the following highly important\ninformation. This fir wood, Mu. Wk. Wilson Saunders, F. R. S.,\nof Lloyd's, has had many opportunities of examining carefully;\nand, in order to satisfy one of our largest importers, he has made\nsome careful expia nls on its strength and flexibility in comparison with other similar woods. The following table, with which\n'he has favored us, gives the result, which is in the highest degree\nsatisfactory. Mr. Wilson Saunders has a regular machine for\nthese experiments, and the results can be implicitly relied on.\nLengths of the woods enumerated in the following table, carefully squared to lj inch, were submitted to pressure of weights\npendent from the centre, the lengths being supported between\nstandards exactly 6 feet apart. The weight at which each broke\nand the amount of deflection from the horizontal line at tbe time\nof breaking, are given in the following table: APPENDIX.\nlbs. Inches.\nDouglas Fir  280 4        Fracture, rough and long.\nPitch Pine  280 4 \" short and even.\nCanada Spruce..   196 4.7 \" short and rough.\nBed Pine  168 6 \" rough.\nLarch\u2014British..  168 5.2 \" short and even.\nDeodar from Himalaya... 154 3.8 \" short.\nTbe specimens experimented upon were carefully selected from\ntbe best description of wood, and free from all defects.   The de-\ni flection is given in inches and tenths of an inch.   Each wood had\ntwo trials, and the figures give a mean result.\"\nDr. Lindley commenting on these tables goes on to say:\n\"It will be thus seen that none of the firs approached  in\nstrength the Douglas  or the Pitch Pine;  it having required the\nweight of 280 lbs. to break a small bar of their wood, no more than an\ninch and a quarter square.    A hundred and sixty-eight pounds broke\na piece of British Larch of the same scantling.    Moreover, between the Douglas Fir and Pitch Pine, whose strength was equal,\nthere is this great difference, that while the latter snapped short\nunder a pressure of 280 lbs., the Douglas yielded unwillingly with\na rough and long rend.\"\nAPPENDIX F-2.\nThe winter of 1835-36 is here referred to. Crossing the Rocky\nMountains from Tete Jaune's Cache to Jasper's in September, on\nfoot, I had returned with a party of some 22 persons, with horses.\nAfter embarking in our canoes and descending Fraser River a few\nmiles, we were ice-bound\u2014the winter being-premature in an unwonted degree\u2014about the 23rd of October. Short of provisions,\nand unable to make our way downwards owing to the unequally\nfrozen condition of the stream, we made a cache of the canoes and\ntheir contents, at a point noted in Arrowsmith's map, and retraced\nour steps to Jasper's\u2014the snow being about nine inches deep at\nthe Summit of the Pass The supplies obtainable at Jasper's\nwere inadequate to our wants; and we had to continue our retreat\ndown the Athabasca, and across to Edmonton on the Saskatchewan. There we obtained copious supplies, with dog-sledges to\nconvey them. Leaving some of the party there, to follow in the\nSpring, we set ont on our return. We had experienced some little\ndifficulty on the way down: but the return-trip, being now provided with snow-shoes, warm clothing, and plenty of pemican, was\nperformed with comparative comfort,\u2014the journey from Edmonton\nto Stuart's Lake occupying only 46 days. It was on this return\ntrip that the observations noted in the text were made. The depth\nof the snow for a short distance at the summit of the Pass was\nabout eight feet\u2014but it was melting very fast at the period of our\npassage, about the 1st January, and there was a warm rain falling.\nNote P. S. referred to at page 67.    \u25a0* ra^*~^j xxxvm.\nAPPENDIX.\nThis thaw, as shewn in the text, was repeated (an interval of two\ndays' cold having been meanwhile experienced) below Tete Jaune's\nCache: and I conjecture was likewise repeated at the summit,\nwhere we had first experienced it. It may be added that the thaw\nin question, as we afterwards ascertained, was not experienced in\nthe lower parts of Fraser River, remote from the mountains, where\ncontinuous cold, of remarkable severity, had prevailed throughout.\nThe object, it may be explained, of the communication at that\ntime maintained through the Tete Jaune Pass, was for the occasional conveyance of dressed Moose-leather, supplied from the\nabundance of the Saskatchewan, for the use of Stuart's Lake and\nthe surrounding Posts, where it was much in demand. Hence the\nroute in question has been frequently called the Leather-Pass.\nAPPENDIX G-2.\nBefore concluding, the Writer thinks, it well to append a memorandum of the principal Works treating directly or indirectly of\nthe-subject in issue which he can recall to memory, and from\nwhich much valuably information can be obtained. From this list,\nhe has designedly excluded the book of a Mr. McDonald, who\nwrote, professing to give an account of British Columbia, some\nyears ago. The Writer has no desire to criticise the work in\nquestion, which, indeed, he has had no opportunity of judging,\nsave from extracts that have been largely quoted by the Press: but\nthese extracts convey an impression so utterly at variance with\nthe observations of others, that, were the contrary not known, he\nmight have inferred that the Author had never set foot within the\nProvince. The valuable work of Lord Milton and Dr. Cheadle\nwill, however, have since corrected many of the false impressions\nwhich the former work was calculated to convey; and the only\nobject in here noticing Mr. McDonald's production is to put those\non their guard who may have imbibed such impressions through\nreading it, without having subsequently met with the salutary\ncorrective.\nFor a similar reason the Writer proceeds to notice a commentary\non the climate of a portion of British Columbia which appeared\nsome years ago; and which, as emanating from a higher and better-\nknown authority, was calculated, if uncorrected, to convey an\nimpression more permanently injurious. The passage in question\nappeared in the Colonization Circular of 1861, and was from the\npen of Mr. John Maclean, formerly a Wintering Partner of the\nHudson's Bay Company, and now residing in Canada. The Writer's\nattention was called to the subject, semi-officially, by the Governor\nof the period, the present Sir James Douglas: and he in consequence wrote a reply to the remarks, which was, it is presumable,\nofficially employed and is here reproduced.\n&4* APPENDIX.\nXXXIX.\nVictoria, V. I., January 3, 1862.\nSir,\u2014My attention has been directed to a passage in a recent\nnumber of the Colonization Circular, having reference to the climate\nof Stuart's Lake in British Columbia. I notice it the more readily\nsince it stands in juxtaposition to another passage in which my\nown name appears.\nWhen Mr. McLean mentions his having witnessed so great a\nvariation of temperature during a single day, he omits, (as quoted)\nto advise his readers that such a day was an exceptional instance\nand not the rule. So far from presenting anywise an ungenial\nclimate, Stuart's Lake is an extremely pleasant place of residence\n\u2014at least so I have always regarded it. The various wild fruits\nflourish and ripen ; and even the crop of the service-berry, which\nwhen in flower you are aware is extremely susceptible to frost, is\nrarely blighted. Potatoes do not always succeed, it is true ; but\nthe failure may, I think, be ascribed usually to errors in the selection of the spots cultivated. Some attention to this point is necessary, in order to avoid the occasional night-frosts to which the\nhollows are subject, but from which the slopes towards the Lake\nare usually free. No better evidence that the climate is on the\nwhole a genial one need be adduced than this\u2014that the tender\nlittle humming-bird is common during summer at Stuart's Lake\nas well as in the less elevated and hotter parts of British Columbia.\nI need not recall Tour Excellency's attention to the fact that\na difference of temperature, equal to at least ten degrees of Latitude, exists during winter between positions on the Pacific Coast,\nas compared with others on the Atlantic. The difference is more\nmarked as we approach the Coast on either side ; but is likewise\nvery perceptible in the Interior of British Columbia, where the\ncold is neither so frequently severe nor so continuous as on the\nEastern side of the Rocky Mountains.\nI have the honor to be,\nTo Sis Excellency \\ &c. &c. &c.\nGovernor Douglas, C.

S. Since the preparation of the above list two works,\ntreating of British Columbia, of recent date, have been brought\nunder my notice ; which, with the reviewer's comments npon one\nof them, form the text for some remarks which I judge it necessary\nto make in the Supplementary Chapter. A copy of one of theso\nworks\u2014called, I think, \" Queen Charlotte Islands \"\u2014by a Mr. 0.\nE. Poole, I have seen and cursorily perused. The other, styled\n\" Very Far West Indeed,\" written professedly by a Mr. R. Byron\nJohnson, I am acquainted with only through the columns of the\nSaturday Review of 25th May last. These works may be read as\nromances\u2014provided, and provided only, they be sufficiently at\ntractive as such ; a very questionable proposition : but as conveying, in the reviewer's words, any \" useful hints as to bow end\n\"where to settle in British Columbia, to the emigrant who has a\n\" natural taste for ' bars and Injuns,1 or whose sense of daring is\n\"tickled by the Rapids of the Fraser,\" both are worse than worthless\u2014ihey are ineffably delusive. In the first we have very wonderful adventures by flood and field. Bears of course figure conspicuously ; Indians are shot down\u2014on paper at least as coolly,\nand with as little compunction, as a Cockney sportsman \" pots \"\nsparrows. Formidable trails are followed over imaginary mountains \" sixteen thousand \" feet in height; and an ordinary canoe\nvoyage, which had been performed scores of times before, and is\nnow almost weekly performed by unpretending travellers passing\nto and fro, is magnified into an exploit exceeding that of Captain\nBligh, of \" Bounty \" celebrity, with which it is specially and most\naudaciously contrasted. Withal it may be said that tbe author\ndocs not apparently seek to convey an injurious impression of the\nProvince as a field for settlement. His faults proceed from a queer\nidiosyncrasy, which prompts him, where personally concerned, to\nview every matter through a magnifying glass, to the constant\nexaltation of his own Individual prowess. The other work, with\nall the faults of the first, contains some astounding statements,\neven more reprehensible, if possible, from an extraneous point of\nview : and, if we may judge from the extracts, is altogether conceived in a spirit of exaggeration and detraction, with motives\nwhich we will not attempt to analyse. A notorious steam-boat\nstory, for instance\u2014apocryphal at tbe beet\u2014has been taken from\ntbe stock traditions of the Lower Mlssisstpi, and adapted to the\nmeridian of the Fraser. Again a sensational anecdote of alleged\nmining adventure In Cariboo, resulting in an asserted execution\nunder \" Lynch-law,\" is gravely related. Whether the occurrence\never happened in any placofre cannot pretend to say\u2014bat this APPENDIX.\nxli.\nmaybe safely affirmed, that it never occurred in any part of British\nColumbia : neither it nor any other similar case of \" Lynch-law.\"\nMiraculous rapids are familiarly talked of, situated midway in the\ncourse of the Fraser, and yet 1,200 miles from its source\u2014the\nthe whole length of the river meanwhile not exceeding 800 miles.\nWe will say nothing of the want of good taste that pervades the\nWork\u2014manifested in many unjustifiable personal allusions\u2014the\ntruth of the assertions in one particular case having moreover been\ndirectly controverted\u2014and notably in the coarse sneer at the religious persuasion of a respectable dealer of the Upper Country,\nwhose name is brought incidentally and unwarrantably on the\ncarpet. Nor will we comment on the barbarous slang which is put\nforward as characteristic of the Country: as if people here habitually talked of \" bars and Injuns and grizzlies ;\" or that the educated American gentlemen who form a highly-respected portion of\nthe community, employ a jargon which, if employed at all, is confined to the rudest classes of the remote interior States.\nEnough, however, of these productions, which I have been\nreluctantly brought to notice. It is a relief to refer once more to\nthe healthily-written book of Lord Milton and Dr. Cheadle, before\nnoticed ; and to join with it the work of Mr. Sproat above mentioned\u2014of which, by the way, I cannot recall the exact title. The\nperusal of these and other similar writings, proceeding from gentlemen of known standing and reputation, will serve to correct the\nerroneous impressions possibly derived from other questionable\nsources. Among the former, however, I ought not to omit special\nreference to the Report of the Honorable Mr. Langevin, before\nnoted\u2014the result of that gentleman's tour through the Province\nin the autumn of last year. I have not yet seen a copy of this\nproduction, but am informed that it contains a mass of statistical\ninformation of the most valuable kind, with remarks justly appreciative of the varied resources and capabilities of the Province.\nAPPENDIX H-2.\nIn direct relation with the remarks at page 102, / quote the\nfollowing passage from the work of Captain Vancouver:^\u2014\n\" Here [at Attowai, Sandwich Islands] we rejoined the American brig Washington.* ********** Amongst other articles\nthat Mr. Kendrick [the master] had procured whilst at Woahoo\nwas eighty pounds of very fine bees-wax that had been drifted by\nthe sea on to the shores of that island, and had very recently been\npicked up by the natives ; and I now understood that some pieces\nhad also been procured from the natives of the other islands by\nMr. Kendrick.\"\u2014Vancouver's Voyage, Vol. V.,p. 121. 8 vo.

H. L. LANGEVIN, C. B., MINISTER OP PUBLIC WORKS.\nBY SANDFORD FLEMING,\nENGINEER-IN-OHIEF.\nOTTAWA, APEIL 10th, 1872.  PROGRESS REPORT\nON THE\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY\nEXPLORATORY SURVEY.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY,\nOffice of the Engineer in Chief.\nOttawa, 10th April, 1872.\nHon. H. L. Langevin, C. B.\nMinister of Public Works,\n&c,       &c,        &c\nSir,\nI have the honor to submit the following preliminary Report on the\nCanadian Pacific Railway Exploratory Survey, commenced in June last\nyear.\nAccording to the terms upon which British Columbia entered the\nDominion of Canada, it became necessary to construct a Railway through\nto the Pacific coast, from some point which would form a junction with\nthe existing Railway system in the Provinces of Ontario-and Quebec.\nThe first important step towards the construction of the Railway,\nbeing to ascertain by instrumental and other examination where a practicable and eligible line could be found, a Survey became necessary.\nThe Parliament, at the last Session made a grant of money towards- the\nSurvey, and the G-overnment subsequently appointed the undersigned to\nconduct it and to carry into execution such steps as might be considered best, in order to discover the most practicable line for the proposed\nRailway and obtain information respecting its general Engineering features.\nIt was deemed important to take such prompt and energetic\naction as would secure as much information on the subject as possible,\nbefore the next meeting of Parliament. si\nThe object of this Report is to give a brief outline of the steps which\nhave been taken to accomplish the desired objects and likewise to present\nin a concise form, the general results of the Survey, up to the present\ntime.\nA point near the River Ottawa, opposite Lake Nipissing was selected\nas the eastern end of the Survey, this point, named \" Mattawa,\" is common\nto and easily connected with the Railways, built and projected, in Ontario\nand Quebec.\nThe Terminus on the Pacific coast is still an open question ; its selection will probably be governed to a considerable extent, by the comparative facilities for Railway construction presented by various projected\nroutes through British Columbia.\nAt the outset of the enquiry all such information regarding the\ncountry extending from Mattawa to the Pacific Coast, as it was possible to\nobtain, was carefully considered, in order to discover where the surveys\nshould be made with the greatest hope of success.\nIt was found that the general direction of the Railway Line would be\ngoverned, by certain important physical features at various points through\nthe country to be traversed.\nProminently among these mav be mentioned; 1st. the very ruge-ed\ncountry along the shores of, and for some distance back of Lakes Huron\nand Superior; 2nd. Lake Nepigon; 3rd. Lake of the Woods; 4th. Lake\nManitoba; 5th. The Rocky Mountains, and lastly the Gold, Selkirk and\nCascade ranges of mountains in British Columbia.\nThe leading features of the country naturally divide the survey into\nthree great divisions.\nFirst.\u2014From Mattawa to Fort G-arry.\nSecond.\u2014From Fort G-arry to the Rocky Mountains.\nThird.-^-Fxom the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast;\nIt will be convenient to refer to the subject under these separate heads.\nMATTAWA TO FORT GARRY.\nVery little information could be obtained respecting a great extent of\nthe country between Mattawa and Fort Garry. It had scarcely been\npenetrated more than a few miles back of the River Ottawa and the Lakes\nHuron and Superior, except on the canoe routes which lead to the outlying-\nposts of the Hudson Bay Company. Along the chain of Lakes extending\nfrom Fort William to Manitoba, however, its character was better undei*\nstood. What was really known of this country, particularly that long stretch\nbetween the Ottawa and the northern bend of Lake Superior, indicated\nthat it was not favourable for Railway construction. Along the coast of\nLake Superior, the ground was reported most impracticable and forbidding\nIt was deemed advisable therefore in projecting a chain of surveys, to\nmake the attempt of piercing through the interior at a considerable distance\nback from the Lake, in the hope of finding ground free from those serious\nobstacles which presented themselves on or near the coast.\nIt was at the same time considered important to make the attempt of\nfinding a practicable line which would touch the navigable waters of Lake\nSuperior, at the nearest point to Fort Garry, viz:\u2014At Nepigon, or Thunder\nBay.\nThe whole distance from Mattawa to Fort Garry was sub-divided\ninto eleven different surveys or divisions, each from 75 to 90 miles in\nlength, with the view of securing a continuous chain of instrumental\nmeasurements, with as little delay as possible.\nThe whole country along the line of projected surveys, embracing\nan extent of not far short of one thousand miles, being densely wooded\nand without a road or trail of any description, made the prosecution of\nthe work unusually difficult.\nA branch survey was authorized from the Nipissing district to Sault\nSte. Marie, to connect with lines projected south of Lake Superior, and\nwith steam boat navigation to Nepigon, or Thunder Bay.\nTo obtain as much information as possible within the year, an expedition was also sent northerly to James' Bay.\nThe last named expedition ascended to the head waters of the river\nOttawa, and Northerly by the river Abbitibbe to Moose Factory, returning by Moose River and Michipicoten River to Lake Superior.\nFORT GARRY TO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS.\nThe country west of Fort Garry, consisting, for the most part, of open\nprairies, and being characterized, even up to the base of the Rocky\nMountains, by physical and engineering features, remarkable for their\nsimplicity; a continuous instrumental survey was not for the present\ndeemed necessary.\nA careful examination of all the information obtainable, showed, however, that, as a general rule, the rivers of the plains west of Fort Garry,\nflow in deeply eroded beds of great width, suggestive of Bridging on a\ngigantic scale. It was found, chiefly from the reports of the Palliser expedition, that\nthe great troughs or valleys through which the streams flow,\nrange over a wide extent of country, from 150 to 300 feet and even\n400 feet in depth under the level plateau on each side ; these great river\ntroughs are at the same time reported, not unfrequently to be about a mile\nand a mile and three quarters in width.\nIt appeared, therefore, of the utmost importance to examine further\ninto this subject with the view of finding a route for the railway through\nthe central plains as direct as possible, avoiding as far as practicable, the\nobstacles referred to, or overcoming them at the least difficult points,\nA double expedition was organized to proceed by different routes,\nbetween Fort Garry and the two most eligible passes through the Rocky\nMountains, viz: The Howse Pass and the Yellow Head Pass.\nThe instructions given this expedition were such as to elicit the\ndesired information.\nTHE  ROCKY MOUNTAINS   TO  THE  PACIFIC.\nIt appeared from all the information that could be gathered from\ndifferent sources that, of all the passes through the Rocky Mountains,\nthose named the Howse and the Yellow Head Passes, would prove most\neligible for the Railway.\nWithin the Province of British Columbia other most serious obstacles to\nRailway construction in any desired direction presented themselves, and\nthe selection not only of one of these Passes, but also of a Terminal point\non the Pacific Coast, seemed to depend on the success which might attend\nany attempt to discover the most practicable line for a railway across the\ninterior of the Province.\nThe survey in British Columbia was divided into Districts, one between\nHowse Pass and Shuswap Lake, a second between Shuswap Lake and the\nStraits of Georgia by the Lower Fraser River, a third between Yellow\nHead Pass and the Upper Fraser River through the Cariboo country.\nEngineers were appointed to conduct the surveys in each of these\nDistricts, and six surveying parties were organized, with the view of\nthoroughly exploring the country, and gaining information which would\nlead to the selection of the most eligible line for the Railway.\nGENERAL ORGANIZATION OF STAFF.\nIn a work of such magnitude, beset with difficulties of no ordinary\nkind and under circumstances which called for as mueh information as possible, with the least possible delay, it was important to organize the\nstaff on a scale and in a manner calculated to secure satisfactory results.\nThe uninhabited, trackless and seemingly impenetrable nature of a\ngreat deal of the country to be explored, rendered it the more important\nthat every means should be taken to prevent failure in obtaining the information sought for, or disaster to any of the parties engaged on the several\nbranches of the survey.\nA Commissariat Department was organized to attend to all matters\nconnected with the procuring and transportation of supplies.\nAs far as it was possible or expedient, a uniform system was instituted\nfor operations in the field and for recording information obtained.\nGeneral and special instructions were drawn up for the guidance of\nevery member of the staff.\nTo simplify correspondence and lessen the chances of mistakes in\nconnection with the Commissariat Department and also for easy general\nreference, the several divisions of the Survey were designated by letters\nof the alphabet and as reference will frequently be made to them in the\ndetail Reports which accompany this, the following explanation is here\npresented:\nDivision Sj\u00bb. Extending from Mattawa to the confluence of the Montreal and Ottawa Rivers.\nDivision C. Extending from the Ottawa to a point near the head of the\nMontreal River.\nDivision I*.

I\nPROGRESS  OF  THE  SURVEY.-\nSome general observations respecting the progress made in the prose-\ncution ot the survey, may now be submitted.\nFull detail information, may be had on reference to the reports and\ndocuments which accompany this.\nIt has been found impossible to maintain regular eommnnioation with\nmany of the partes engaged on the surrey during the winter but iudri\u2122\nfrom the Progress Eeperts last reeled, the undesigned feels 2S\nstaring that the surveys projected in, June   last between  M,tw7\nthe Ottawa and Nepigon Bay on Lake Superior are now* wfttol I\nceprion, completed and that only two  breaks in the suryey^ exist betwetn\nNepigon Bay and Fort Garry. ' oexween\nNo serious engineering difiicultv has been mptwri+fc I        II\nI The day on which British-Columbia entered the Dominion. however, to speak so favourably of the country covered by Divisions Oand\nM of the survey, embracing over one hundred miles easterly from the\nRiver Nepigon. This section is excessively rough and mountainous, and\nthe survey made through it, did not result in finding a practicable line for\nthe Railway.\nWest, from Nepigon River to Fort G-arry, although two Divisions of\nthe Survey are incomplete, enough is now known of the country to warrant the belief that it will admit of a practicable line with favourable\ngrades for the greater part of the distance.\nExplorations are now being made with the view of ascertaining how far\nit may be practicable to avoid the very serious difficulties referred to on\nDivisions CJ and H, by running the Railway Line further in the interior;\nit has already been found that the rocky and broken country, which presents itself on the shore of Lake Superior, changes very much at a distance\nof 50 or 60 miles to the north, and from what has been learned it is thought\nthat a perfectly practicable Line will be discovered by the north side of\nLake Nepigon. Definite information on this point cannot be' received before navigation opens between Collingwood and Lake Superior, when the\nparties engaged on the exploration are expected to return, but the Line\ndrawn on the map by the north side of Lake Nepigon shows the general\ndirection in which, from the very latest information received, a practicable\nand favorable Line may be confidently expected.\nThe survey and exploration made from Sault Ste. Marie easterly along\nthe northern shore of the G-eorgian Bay towards Lake Nipissing, establish\nthe fact that a good Line can be had with very favorable grades.\nThe expedition to James Bay had no difficulty in passing from the\nRiver Ottawa northerly to tide water at the mouth of the Abbitibbe, and in\nreturning to Lake Superior by Moose River. The Report, which accompanies this, furnishes some interesting information.\nThe Expeditions sent out to examine several projected routes across the\nPlains west of Fort G-arry, and extending up to the Howse Pass on the one\nhand, and the Yellow Head Pass on the other, have returned after accomplishing the service satisfactorily.\nThe information thus derived shows that on some of the routes, the\ncost of carrying the Railway across the River Valleys would be very great,\nbut that a comparatively favourable route in this respect as well as in\nothers, may be had by following the general direction shown on the\naccompanyino- Map. \u2022 This route, which from all present information,\nappears likely to prove the most favorable, is shown on the Map by a Line .\ndrawn from a crossing of the Red River, north of Fort G-arry   by Dauphin\n2 10\n11\nm i\nan  ;\nail! i\n1\nI\nI\nLake, Swan River, the elbow of the North Saskatchewan, Battle River,\nBeaver Lake, and thence via the Jasper House to the Yellow Head Pass.\nOn some other routes it was found that the great Rivers flowed in troughs,\nenormously deep and wide; but the line drawn on the Map appears from\nall the information obtained to involve the least amount of Bridging, while at\nthe same time it passes through or near the most available country for settlement ; the South Saskatchewan can be crossed on this Line by a bridge,\n1,400 feet long, not exceeding sixty feet in height above water level,\nand about 70 feet above the bed of the River at the deepest point.\nThere will probably be even less difficulty in spanning the North Saskatchewan, and as these are the largest rivers to be crossed on the Line\nlaid down, the comparatively favorable points for crossing them, which\nhave been found, is considered extremely fortunate, considering the general features of the great water channels in this wide extent of country.\n\"With regard to the Survey between the Rocky Mountains and the\nPacific Coast, although a great deal still remains to be done, material progress has undoubtedly been made.\nA very favorable line for a railway has been found through the Oold\nRange by the Eagle Pass, extending from Little Dalles on the Columbia\nRiver to Great Shuswap Lake, and an Instrumental survey has been completed from the foot of the last named Lake to Hope on the Lower Fraser\nRiver. The general engineering features of the approaches to Howse\nPass, have also been ascertained.\nThe surveying expedition which left Yictoria on the 20th July to find\na moderately direct line from Quesnel Mouth, through the Cariboo country\nto Tete Jaune Cache, has failed in its object. The lowest pass discovered\nthrough the Selkirk range, although about 1000 feet lower than the\nmountains adjoining is reported to be at such an elevation, that the ground\nfalls on one side 1600 feet in five miles and on the other 2300 feet in about\nsix miles, thus proving the pass impracticable for a Railway, unless with a\nTunnel at an enormous cost.\nA favourable pass from the North Fraser River in the neighborhood\nof T6te Jaune Cache, to the north branch of the Thompson River has been\nfound.\nAccording to the information received, this will admit of a line being\nconstructed from Yellow Head Pass to Kamloops, with grades not exceeding 50 feet per mile.\nThe fortunate discovery of a practicable line with grades so favourable,\nbetween Kamloops and the summit of the Rocky Mountains, via the north\nThompson and Yellow Head Pass, together with information received from the expedition, which examined the country on the eastern slope of\nthe mountains, led to the abandonment of all farther work on the survey\nvia Howse Pass.\nKamloops is an important point on the line which was being surveyed\nfrom New Westminster through the Eagle Pass to Howse Pass. The\ndistance from Kamloops to a common point near Edmonton House, is not\ngreater by the North Thompson and Yellow Head Pass, than it is by\nEagle and Howse Pass, while all information goes to show that a very\nmuch better and less costly line can be had by the former than by the\nlatter route.\nFinding that Kamloops could be easier reached from the eastern\nslope of the Rocky Mountains by the Yellow Head than ' by the Howse\nPass, there was no longer,any object in continuing operations east of\nKamloops on the latter route.\nThis led to the adoption by the G-overnment on the 2nd inst., of the\nYellow Head Pass as the gate to British Columbia from the east.\nThe adoption of the Yellow Head Pass has greatly simplified the\nSurvey, and now the efforts of the whole staff in British Columbia, are\nconcentrated on lines leading to one common point, viz: Tete Jaune Cache,\nin about longitude 120 \u00b0 and latitude 53 \u00b0 . It being impossible to reach\nthe Pass selected through the Rocky Mountains from the west, without\nfirst touching the River Fraser at this point.\nThe next important consideration is the establishment of the Railway\nroute from Tete Jaune Cache, to the Pacific coast.\nIt has\" already been mentioned that there will be no difficulty in\nbuilding a railway with very favourable grades from Tete Jaune Cache to\nKamloops. From Kamloops a survey has been made to Burrards Inlet\n(the harbour of New Westminster) except about seventy miles on the extreme western end of the line, and on the latter section no serious difficulties are believed to exist. This survey shows that a practicable line with\nfavorable grades may be had, although the cost, particularly along the\ncanons of the lower Fraser River, will be considerably above an average.\nThe Harbour of Esquimault, near Victoria on Vancouver's Island, is\nstrongly advocated by some as the point where the Railway should terminate. To reach Esquimault without break, it will be necessary\nto bridge the Straits of Georgia in the neighborhood of Valdes Island\nwhere the channel is narrowest, and the question of bridging can only be\nsettled by careful surveys now ordered.\nAssuming that it may be found practicable to form a bridge connection between Vancouver's Island and the mainland, the physical formation 12\nII\nu\np:\n11'\nP\ni m'\nI\nIB \u25a0\nJ!* i\nPi\nfill.\n*!:\n\u25a0li1!\nIll1\nHi\n_Ei'i\nf!\nI\nof the country will render it necessary to carry the line along by Bute\nInlet. It is important, therefore, to ascertain how Bute Inlet can be\neasiest reached from Tete Jaune Cache.\nAlthough the attempt made last year to find a short line across the\nCariboo country in the required direction proved unsuccessful, all farther\nefforts have not been abandoned. The work of exploration has been\ncarried on during the winter and a diligent search will be continued\nwherever success is at all possible. Some hopes are entertained that a\nline may be found from the North Thomspon across the Selkirk Range\nto the Quesnel Lakes and thence via Quesnel mouth to Bute Inlet, but\nshould this fail, a careful examination will' be made about fifty miles\nfarther to the south on a line projected through by Horse Lake and Lake\nLa Hache. Should all these explorations prove failures,' it is confidently believed that it will be quite possible to reach Bute\nInlet by a practicable line from T\u00a7te Jaune Cache, going round the Cariboo\ncountry on the north side along the banks of the Fraser River, and thence\nacross the Chilcotin plains. The only serious objection to the latter route\nwill be its length. The gradients can scarcely fail to be favorable on\naccount of the line following the river for over 250 miles on a uniform\nand gradual descent.\nBesides Burrards Inlet and Esquimault, other harbours accessible from\nthe Pacific have been spoken of for the Terminus. Of these may.be men-'\ntioned Alberni at the head of Barclay Sound, another harbour at Nootka\nSound, Bentick Arm, also Port Essington, or some suitable point at the\nmouth of tiie Skeena River. It is somewhat premature, however, to discuss\nthe merits of any of these points without further information respecting\nthe means of reaching them from Tete Jaune Cache.\nIn concluding a summary of what has been accomplished since the\nsurvey was instituted in June last, it is greatly to be regretted that more\ndefinite information has not yet been received respecting the' explorations\nnow in progress east and west of Lake Nepigon, in the rear of the rugged\nbelt along Lake Superior.\nAssuming, however, and enough it is believed is known to warrant\nthe assumption, that all difficulties in this quarter will be obviated, it may\nbe claimed that the practicability and the general direction of the Railway\nLine from Ottawa to Fort G-arry, thence across the great'plains and the\nRocky Mountains to Tete Jaune Cache has approximately been determined\nand that from the last named point at least one line to the waters of the\nPacific Ocean has been found practicable.\nit will be interesting to compare some of the features of the line re- 13\nferred to in the last paragraph with the Union Pacific Railway in the\nUnited States, for this purpose a diagram accompanies this, showing thereon\nprofiles of both.\nFrom this diagram it will be seen that the Union Pacific Railway*\nextending from Omaha to San Francisco, runs, for 1,300 miles or three-\nfourths of its entire length, at a higher level than the Yellow Head Pass,\nand that this point, the great summit of the Canadian Pacific Railway line,\nis less than half the elevation attained at several points on the line now\nbeing operated across the Continent.\nA Table giving the distances between some of the principal points in\nthe country extending from the Ottawa Valley to the Pacific coast is\nappended hereto. It is not to be supposed that this Table has any great\npretensions to accuracy, except in the case of Railways built or surveyed, in other cases the distances are simply ascertained by measurement on the maps of the country, and it is not at all certain that even the\nbest maps are free from grave errors. Be this as it may, there are no\nmeans of checking the distances, until the- chain of surveys are connected\nfrom end to end and the results known. It is believed, however, that even\nrough approximate distances may be useful to the Government in considering the question of the Railway, and for this purpose they are presented.\nOne or two points brought out by the Table of Comparative distances\nare worthy of note.\nMontreal and Toronto are the chief Commercial centres in the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and it is important to ascertain how they can\nbest be reached from a point in the Interior\u2014say Fort Garry.\nAccording to the Table, the distance between Montreal and Fort Garry\nby the line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, is 1,180 miles, while by Railway projected through Sault Ste. Marie, Duluth and Pembina, the distance\nis 1,440 miles, and by way of Chicago and St. Paul, the distance is 1,843\nmiles\u2014showing that by the three all-rail routes, made or projected between\nFort Garry and Montreal, the Canadian Pacific line is 260 miles shorter\nthan the line passing through Sault Ste. Marie, and 663 miles shorter than\nthe route at present travelled via Chicago and St. Paul.\n' Taking Toronto as a starting point, and using the Northern or Nipis-\nsing Railways as far as Bracebridge, thence connecting them with the\nCanadian Pacific Railway at Mattawa, it appears from the Table that the\ntotal distance to Fort Garry is 1,110 miles, while by way of Bracebridge,\nSault Ste. Marie, Duluth and Pembina, the distance is 1,290 miles, and by\nway of Chicago and St. Paul the distance is 1,507 miles, thus establishing\n\u2022Embracing the Central Pacific Railway. Bnli\n1 \\v\nP\n1\na\ni S'i\n14\nthe fact, that of the three all-rail routes made or projected between Fort\nGarry and Toronto, the Canadian Pacific is 170 miles shorter than the\nroute via Sault Ste. Marie and Duluth, and close on 400 miles less than the\nRailway route via Chicago and St. Paul.\nIt will be farther seen that, during the season of -open navigation, the\ndistance between Toronto and Fort Garry via Nepigon, is 1,074 against\n1274 miles via Duluth and that part of the Northern Pacific Railway east\nof Pembina\u2014giving a saving of 200 miles in favour of the Canadian\nPacific, and branch to Nepigon, of which saving 40 miles is rail and 160\nmiles water.\nViewing the Canadian Pacific Railway as a \" through\" route between\nPorts on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the comparative Profile referred\nto in a previous paragraph, and which accompanies this, illustrates the\nremarkable engineering advantages which it possesses over the Union\nPacific Railway. The lower altitudes to be reached, and the more favorable\ngradients, are not, however, the only advantages.\nA careful examination into the question of distances, shows, beyond\ndispute, that the Continent can be spanned by a much shorter line on\nCanadian soil than by the existing railway through the United States.\nReferring to the Table again, it will be seen that the distance from San\nFrancisco to New York, by the Union Pacific Railway, is 3,363 miles,\nwhile from New Westminster to Montreal it is only 2,730 or 633 miles in\nfavor of the Canadian route.\nA closer examination of the Table will show that by the construction\nof the  Canadian Pacific Railway,  even New York, Boston and Portland\nwill be brought from 300 to 500 miles nearer the Pacific coast than they are\nat present.\nA comparison of distance between distant points which may form\ntraffic connections with the Inter-Oceanic Railways of North America, bring\nout some important facts referred, to in the Table.\nCompared with the Union Pacific Railway, the Canadian Line will\nshorten the passage between Liverpool and China, in direct distance, more\nthan one thousand miles.\nWhen the remarkable Engineering advantages which appear to be ob.\ntainable on the Canadian Line and the very great reduction in mileage above\nreferred to are taken into consideration, it is evident that the Canadian\nPacific Railway, in entering into competition for the Through Traffic between the two Oceans, will possess in a very high degree the essential\nelements of success. It has been found impossible to make any comparison with the Northern\nPacific Railway, projected through the Territories of the United States to\nPuget Sound, as no reliable information could be obtained respecting\ndistances, gradients, elevations, or probable route, except on that portion of\nthe undertaking east of the Red River.\nIn concluding this Report it may not be out of place E remark that a\nSurvey of such magnitude through a country for the most part uninhabited\nand destitute of the means of shelter or subsistence could not be prosecuted\nwithout encountering risks and hardships to the individuals engaged.\nThe serious responsibility of keeping all the various parties properly\nsupplied with at least common necessaries of food was fully appreciated\nfrom the beginning, and although supplies may, in isolated cases, have run\nshort, no actual suffering from want has been reported.\nIt greatly grieves me to report the loss of seven poor men, who\nperished last summer through forest fires while\" engaged in carying provisions to one of the surveying parties north of Lake Superior.\nNo other very serious disaster has occurred, although several narrow\nescapes have been met with. Since the winter set in several men have\nbeen badly frozen.\nIt is impossible to speak too highly of the courage and endurance displayed by members of the Staff, more especially of those who, in order to\ncarry out the wishes of the Government with as little delay as possible, did\nnot hesitate, after the summer's campaign had terminated, to remain out on\nthe exploration during the winter.\nSome of these parties have been out for nearly ten consecutive months\nembracing the whole of winter with all its severity. The service under the\ncircumstances of country and climate could not fail to be a very severe\none. It was impossible to supply them adequately with shelter or change\nof diet, in consequence of which several painful cases of scurvy have\nresulted.\nAll hardships and deprivations have, however, been braved and endured in a manner deserving of the highest commendation.\nIt is extremely gratifying to be able to report that with very few exceptions all the members of the Staff, including those engaged in the Commissariat Branch, entered on their several duties with great zeal, and\nexerted themselves in every possible way to bring the work to a successful\nissue. \u00a5\u25a0\n\u25a0k\nk\niw\nIt is due to the Officers of the Hudson Bay Company to state that\nwherever they were met with, they extended to the parties engaged on\nthe survey much very acceptable kindness and assistance.\nThe Indians along the whole route proved remarkably friendly, when\nthe nature and objects of the several expeditions were explained to them.\nMany of them rendered valuable service in various ways, in connection\nwith the work.of exploration.\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour Obedient Servant,\n-Sandford Fleming,\nEngineer-in- Chief.

Having had no opportunity of consulting with him, or with Mr. Moberly and Mr. McLennan,\nwhom I met for a few minutes only on their way up country, I was\nunable to move so actively in organizing parties to commence work as I\ncould have wished. The time, however, was not altogether lost, as it\nenabled me to collect the necessary material with which to form my two\nparties\u2014a work of very considerable difficulty, as nearly all the professional\ngentlemen available in the colony were already engaged on the survey.\nKnowing how small a portion of the autumn there was remaining\nsuitable for field operations, and how desirable it was to obtain as much\ninformation as possible before the close of the year, I judged it advisable\nto commence work at the nearest point; more particularly as it would\nembrace the canons of the Fraser and Thompson Rivers, which present\nthe most serious obstacles to the construction of a railway.\nHaving completed my preparations, I left Victoria on Tuesday the\n5th September, and reached Yale (the head of the steamboat navigation on.\nthe Lower Fraser, and distant from New Westminster by the river about\nninety-five miles) on the following Thursday, the 7th September.\nFrom this point I detached Mr. Huxd (whom I had placed in charge of\nthe U party) to Lytton, at the confluence of the Fraser and Thompson\nixivers, and distant fifty-seven miles by the waggon-road from Yale;\n\"with instructions to form a camp near that place, and survey up the left\nbank of the Thompson towards Eagle Pass. M\nI moved the W party out to camp on Saturday, the 9th September,\nand Mr. Homfray, who had been left behind when we started from\nVictoria, having arrived at Yale on Sunday, I placed the par-ty in his\ncharge with directions to survey up the river to Lytton. On Monday I\nwent over apportion of the line with him, and selected the toll gate near\nYale as the initial point from which to commence the survey, directing\nhim to keep as near as practicable on a suitable grade for the railway.\nThe following morning, after seeing them commence work, I drove to\nLytton, and found Mr. Hurd had arrived with his party the day before,\nand had formed a camp about two miles above Lytton. The next day,\nWednesday, 13th September, I spent going over the line with Mr. Hurd,\ndetermined on the Court House at Lytton for the starting point, and the\nfollowing day the party commenced work.\nI remained with them two days, advising Mr. Hurd as to the course\nof the line, until Mr. \"Watt arrived, when I accompanied him to Kamloops,\nwhere he purchased a train of twenty-six animals for the use of the IJ\nparty in moving their camp, etc.\nI reached Kamloops on \"Wednesday, having taken the opportunity to\ncome up the lake in a canoe, so as to be better able to judge of the nature\nof its shores. The horse trail by which I had always previously travelled\ntakes back from the lake soon after leaving Saraua's Ferry, and follows over\nvery high ground in order to avoid the great Bluff above Cherry Creek,\nwhich rises nearly perpendicularly from the waters edge to a height of\nabout eleven hundred and thirty (1,130) feet above the lake. This bluff is\nabout one and three quarter (If) mile iu length, and presents a very serious obstacle to the construction of a railway.\nAfter purchasing and despatching the pack trs\nto Lytton, I started\nthe next day, Saturday, September 23rd, to make an exploration of the\ncontry between the head, of the Little Shuswap Lake and the mouth of\nthe Eagle Pass, the result of which was entirely satisfactory, as I found\nthat the line could be taken by either of two valleys to the south west or\nSalmon river arm of the Great Shuswap Lake, thus avoiding a long detour\nof many miles along the shore of the lake, which will at once be seen on\nreferring to the map. The first line leaves the little Shuswap Lake, at its\nhead, and follows a valley through which an Indian horse-trail runs\nto the Okanagan, with a general course to the south-east. By the second\nline the south-shore of the Great Shuswap Lake would be followed for\nabout four  or\nfiv(\nmiles from   its  outlet,  when\n;ne\nline would  leave\nit, and running a little east of south, would gain the Salmon river arm\nat the same point as the first. The distance by the first line is shorter, but\nthe height to be surmounted would be somewhat greater than that by the\nsecond line. I could not place much reliance, however, on the barometer,\nas the weather was very stormy and changeable. On resuming work I\nintend to run a level from the Little Lake to the summit of the first Pass;\nand should I find the aseent too heavy, I shall continue on to the Great 22\nLake, and run the line through the second valley to the Salmon river arm.\nFrom the mouth of Salmon River I continued along the shore of the\nlake, which is much easier than I had anticipated, to the Shickamouse\nNarrows near the mouth of Eagle River, where Mr. Moberley's district\ncommences.\nThe Narrows is a shallow channel connecting the two lakes, and about\nthree hundred (300) feet in width. The bottom is composed of sand and\ngravel, and the Indians have a fish-weir across it. The depth at the time\nI was there could not have been more than four or five feet. After\nspending some days in examining the country in that neighborhood, I\nreturned by way of Salmon River and Nicola Lake to Spence's Bridge (by\nwhich the Cariboo waggon road crosses the Thompson River twenty-three\nmiles above Lytton), arriving there on the evening of Sunday the 15th\nOctober.\nI cannot help thinking that a better and certainly a much shorter line\nfor a railway can be obtained by way of Nicola Lake to Hope, than the\none surveyed last Autumn by the Thompson and Fraser Valleys; and I\nwill here quote what I wrote to you in my letter of the 4th November\nlast, in reference to this subject:\u2014\" This route from Eagle Pass, by way\nof Salmon River and Nicola Lake, offers great facilities for the construction\nof a railway.    The gradients would be very easy, and there are no heavy\nbluffs to be  encountered.    A saving of from   forty to   fifty   miles   in\ndistance would also be effected, should any pass through the Cascade\nrange be found by which to connect Nicola Lake directly with Hope, and\nall the difficulties of the canons of the Thompson and Fraser Rivers would\nbe avoided.    Unfortunately the lateness of the season precluded the possibility of my attempting any exploration of these mountains during the\npresent year,  but I consider it highly desirable that they should be\nexamined next summer.    The chief difficultv would be in descending to\nHope, as Nicola Lake is nearly two thousand \"(2,000) feet above the sea.\"\nOn my arriving at Spence's Bridge, I found that the U party had\npassed some days before,   and  were then camped about twelve  miles\nabove, on the left bank of the river.    The next day I rode out to their\ncamp, and finding that they were getting on satisfactorily with the line I\nleft them the following day, and travelled to Lytton, where I learned that\nthem party had already returned to Yale, after completing the survev to\nthat place.    I therefore proceeded on and reached Yale on the 19th October\nwhen I found that the party had arrived, and were preparing to survev\nfrom Yale towards Burrard Inlet.    After seeing them commence work I\nstarted for Victoria for the purpose of obtaining several articles of which\nthe party was in need, and arrived here on Wednesday, October 25th\nRemaining oyer one steamer, I left again on the following Tuesdav  and\njoined Mr. Homfray s party on Friday, November 3rd, at the listers\nRocks,   some ten miles below Yale, where I found them encamped  the\nline haying previously been brought down to that point ' 23\nThe weather, which had hitherto been fine, now became very wet\nand stormy, and greatly retarded the progress of the survey. Deeming it\nof the utmost importance, however, that as much information as possible\nshould be obtained before closing operations for the season, I determined\nto continue the party at work for some time longer, although at considerable disadvantage, giving Mr. Homfray directions to break up the camp\nand return with his party to Victoria, when he found it useless to continue\nlonger in the field.\nLeaving Yale on Monday, November 5th, I reached Mr. Hurd's camp\non Kamloops Lake,, near the mouth of Cherry Creek, on Friday, the 9th, and\nfound that the party had just completed the survey to that point. I spent\nthat afternoon in company with Mr. Hurd in examining the Great Bluff; and\nthe next day we started to run the line over the crest of it, as we found it\nwould be quite impossible to keep near the water's edge, the bluff in some\nplaces being precipitous. The following day, (Sunday,) it was bitterly\ncold, with driving snow; Monday was the same, so that the party was\nunable to move out of camp. The winter had now set in, and considerably earlier than usual; but, in ignorance of this fact and in hopes that\nthe weather would moderate every day,\" the party continued at work,\nand eventually succeeded in reaching the foot of the Great Shuswap Lake\non December 4th, thus fulfilling the instructions I had given them, and\naccomplishing the object I had in view, viz.:\u2014to obtain a section from\nLytton to the Great Shuswap Lake.\nAfter accompanying the party twenty miles beyond Kamloops, I\nleft them and returned to that place on November 27th, when I made\narrangements to winter the pack-train, and store the balance of the supplies,\ncamp equipage, &c, on the return of the party. I left Kamloops on the\n1st December, (at which time the Indians were crossing horses over the\nThompson on the ice,) and reached Cornwall's, on the waggon-road the\nnext day, when I engaged with him to send his waggon to Savana's Ferry,\nand bring the party down to Lytton. On the morning of the 3rd December, the thermometer at this place (Ashcroft) stood at 20\u00b0 below zero. I\nreached Lytton on the 4th December, and Yale on the 7th, the travelling\nbeing very 'bad from the quantity of snow and ice on the road.\nOn my arrival at Yale, I found that Mr. Homfray had not yet returned\nto Victoria, having gone into winter quarters at Hope, some three weeks\npreviously,'with all its party. The following morning I started early in a\ncanoe, and, calling at Hope, gave Mr. Homfray strict injunctions to store\nall his provisions, &c, and bring his party down without further loss of\ntime to Victoria. The same night I reached New Westminster, where I\nwas detained three days waiting for the steamer, and finally reached\nVictoria on December 12th. Mr. Homfray arrived with the V party on\nthe 16th, when the men were immediately paid off; and Mr. Hurd with\nthe U party, on the following Saturday, December 20th, when his party\nwas also paid off and discharged. 24\nII\nm\nm\n\u25a0 111\ni:!;;ii'\nfr\na *',1\nFT\nill\nif!\n1\nHaving thus given you an account of the operations for the season, of the\ntwo parties in the field, I may here state that the result of their work may be\nconsidered satisfactory, since it has established the fact that an easy grade\ncan be obtained from the Pacific Ocean to the mouth of Eagle Pass ; and\nthe surveys made by Mr. Moberly's parties by th valley of Eagle River,\nacross the gold range to the Big Eddy of the Columbia, and from the\nmouth of Blaeberry River, through Howse Pass to the Kootani Plain, on\nthe east side of the Rocky Mountains, prove that these two formidable\nmountain ranges can be crossed with much less difficulty than had hitherto\nbeen believed possible.\nAlthough the Y party was unable, in consequence of the earliness\nand severity of the winter, to reach tide-water, as I had one time hoped\nthey would be able to do, the section is not hi any Way materially affected\nas the survey has been brought through the Cascade Range to the wide open\nvalley of the Lower Fraser, and the fall from the closing part of their\nwork, estimated by barometrical observations, is only 232Jxeet, distributed\nover a distance of sixty-nine (69) miles. There is still, however, a good\ndeal of work to be done to reach the sea from Hope, as the line will\nhave to be carefully explored in order to aVoid numerous sloughs, and\nground overflowed during the summer freshet; and as most of the country\nis covered with very heavy timber and a dense undergrowth, the progress\nof this pOTtion of the survey must necessarily be slow. . Lohg bridges will\nbe required to cross Harrison and Pitt Rivers, which can be constructed\nof timber as no ice or drift logs run dowh them and They have very^\nlittle current, the waters being backed up, in the summer, by the Fraser.\nml\n! ft\nI\nIn addition to the plahs and sections on the large scale directed, I\nhave had a smaller section made, which will show at a glance the relative\nheights from the sea to the Great Shuswap Lake, and a$so a plan, on the\nsame scale of two miles to the inch, of the whole district from Eagle Pas&\nto Burrard Inlet. On it I have marked, by a firm red line, the course run\nlast autumn from Hope to the Great Shuswap Lafee, by the valleys of the\nFraser and Thompson Rivers; and by a red dotted line, the portion\nat either end yet remaining to be surveyed in order to connect Eagle Pass\nwith the Pacific Ocean.\nI have also laid down on the map my exploration by Salmon River\nand Nicola Lake, so that you may thus be better able to judg^ of the advantages a line by that route would possess, should I be successful this\nsummer in discovering some pass through the Cascade Mountains by which\nto descend to Hope.\nli'\nI\nAlthough the section by the Fraser and Thompson Valleys shews a\nvery easy grade, and a large portion of the country is favourable for a railway, particularly from Spencer's Bridge to the Shuswap Lake, excepting\nonly the G-reat Bluff near Cherry Creek ; there are serious difficulties to\nbe encountered in&he Fraser Canon and between Lytton and Spence's\nBridge.    The   first twenty-one miles from Yale,  until China   Bluff  is 25\npassed, being one continuous succession of precipitous rocky points and\nside hills, broken only in a few places by gravel benches. From China\nBar Bluff to Lytton, with the exception of Jackass Mountain and the bluff\nsix miles below Lytton, the country is much more favorable, as a\nnumber of gravel benches can be followed. Above Lytton there are several\nrocky points to be passed before reaching the Nicaomin, and one about\nthree miles beyond that stream. The rest of the line to Spence's Bridge\nwould run along the face, and at the foot of steep gravelly hill sides.\nThere is one point, and only one, on the whole line where wet and springy\nground is met with, at the Mud Mountain so named, between pegs 901 and\n919 from Lytton. The soil at this place is composed of a reddish yellow\nmarl intermixed with fragments of rock and alkali, and appears to be constantly but slowly being pushed down to the river by the superincumbent\nmass . The slope is not steep, the angle being about 25 degrees, but\nit extends a very considerable distance up into a gorge of the mountain. It\nevidently rests on sloping rock, which, indeed presents itself at the bank\nof the river, where it has a .precipitous face of about fifty feet in\nheight. In the spring this ground is very rotten and treacherous, and it is\nwith difficulty that the drains can be kept opened ; later on in the summer\nit becomes hard and compact, forming an admirable road.\nAt Spence's Bridge, formerly Cook's Ferry, the open bunch grass\ncountry fairly commences and continues without interruption to the foot\nof the Little Shuswap Lake, beyond which point the country is thickly\ntimbered with fir, pine and some cedar.\nThe formation of this section of the country is very peculiar, being\ncomposed, like all the valleys east of the Cascade Range, of a number of\nbenches rising in succession one above the other, of greater or less height,\nand broken at intervals by rocky points. Many of these flats or benches\nare composed of very rich soil, and raise large crops of grain and\nvegetables, where water can be obtained for irrigation; others again are\nsomewhat stony and gravelly, but they are all covered, as well as the high\nbald hills behind them, with a luxuriant growth of bunch grass, on which\ncattle and horses become fat very speedily, and keep in condition throughout the winter.\nOn the Bonaparte and Thompson Rivers, and in the neighborhood of\nKamloops, there are many fine farms, upon which a large amount of grain\nis raised, but not nearly to the extent that is possible, the market at present\nbeing very limited. Most of the settlers devote their attention to the raising\nof cattle, which are easily driven to the mining districts, and find there a\nready sale.\nSix miles from Yale on the waggon-road, limestone is found, from\nwhich lime of excellent quality has been obtained for building purposes.\nThe lime for the masonry of the Alexandra Suspension Bridge was burnt\nhere. Limestone also appears on both banks of the Thompson, about eight\nmiles above Spence's Bridge, and at Nickola Lake and other points. 26\nm\nft I\nII\nI'\nWmh :\nm\nif\nili\nR !\ni  !\nll!\nli\nIfi\nlis:\nm\nHi!\nAt Nickola Lake there has also been discovered a seam of coal of\nsuperior quality, and six feet in thickness. Small quantities have, from\ntime to time, been packed down on horses to Cook's Ferry and Lytton\nduring the last two or three ye'ars, and it is highly esteemed for black-\nsmithing purposes.\nFor a more detailed description of the country and the line run, I\nwould refer you to the plans and sections, and to reports and diaries of\nthe two engineers in charge, Mr. Hurd and Mr. Homfray, which I forward\nwith this. I also send a short report from Mr. McClure, explanatory of\nhis section from Yale to Lytton. In future I have directed that the level\nbe run on the surveyed line, unless where prevented by some insuperable\nobstacle. The dotted line on the plans will show where deviations, from\nthe traverse line run, are suggested.\nI also enclose with the plans the originals of all the field notes, copies\nof which I have had made, and shall retain for reference here. I have also\nkept copies of the plans and sections.\nAnnexed is a statement of the total expenditure on account of the\ntwo parties up to the 31st December last, amounting in all to $24,211.76 ;\ndeducting from the sum the value of stores on hand, pack-train, &c, it will\nbe seen that the actual cost of the work done under my charge is $16,716.10.\nI am glad to be able to state that I heard from Kamloops last week that all\nthe animals of my pack-train which I left there in charge of Captain Layton,\nhad survived the winter, and were improving in condition.\nImmediately after despatching the plans and reports, I shall send out\nthe two parties to resume the surveys at the points where they discontinued\nwork last winter.\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\nJOHN TRUTCH,\nDistrict Engineer.\nIll\nmi' 27\n-AJPi^jsrsratx: tvo. 3.\n(Progress Report from Walter Moberly, Esq., in charge of the District between\nGreat Shuswap Lake and Kootanie Plain.)\nVictoria, February 24th, 1872.\nSandford Fleming, Esq,.,\nEngineer-in-Chief, Canadian Pacific Railway, Ottawa,\ng!B5\u2014I have the honor to forward you a report of the progress made\nin carrying out the Exploratory Survey, of the \"Howse Pass District\"\nof the Canadian Pacific Railway, of which I have charge.\nI am glad to be able to inform you that my explorations last season,\nin connection with those made in former years by me,* of that portion\nof British Columbia, situated between the 49 and 52 parallels of North Latitude and extending from the gulf of G-eorgia to the easterly boundary of\nthe Province, and thence easterly along the valley of the North Saskatchewan river to the north easterly end of the \"Kootanie Plain\" have resulted\nin the discovery of a tolerably direct and practicable line for a railway\nfrom the \"Pacific Ocean\" to the \"Kootanie Plain\"; and, considering the\nnature of the country west of the water shed of the Rocky Mountains, a\nmuch more favorable line than was, previous to those explorations,\nexpected. (See Capt. Palliser's General Report. Dated April 4th, 1862.\nPage 16. \"Objection to a line of railway across North America to the\nPacific\") As a detailed report of the District extending from the westerly\nboundary of my District to the Pacific coast will be furnished you by Mr.\nJohn Trutch, the Engineer in charge, I shall in this report confine myself\nto the limits of my own District, which includes the most formidable\nmountains in the Dominion, viz. : The Rocky, the Selkirk and Gold ranges.\nI arrived at Victoria from San Francisco on the 13th July last. Mr. R.\nMcLennan who has charge of the explorations via the 'Yellowhead Pass;' Mr.\nG-eorge \"Watt Paymaster and Commissariat Officer of the Canadian Pacihc\nRailway and the rest of the staff appointed in Ottawa also came by the\nsame boat. We used our utmost exertions to get the different parties,\ntoo-ether with their supplies and instruments, en route for the interior, but\nexperienced some delay as many articles had to be made before leaving.\nVictoria, and the majority of the men needed to fill the parties, engaged^\nWe were also unable at first to get pack animals or other modes of\nconvevance for the transportation of our supplies, &c to the remote portions of the country to which we had to repair. We however, managed\nto land the advance party on the mainland of British Columbia^on the 20th\nof Julv\u2014the day upon which it became a portion of the Dominion of\nCanada-and on the 25th of the same month the rest of our parties destined\nfor the Yellowhead and Howse Passes sailed for the Fraser river.\n\u2022Explorations have also been made, by others, of the country below Kamloops. 28\nIf\ni\nto\nm\nlit*\nw\nm\nI\nMr. Arthur Selwyn, Director of the Provincial G-eological Survey, and\nhis party also left by the same boat. I landed at Hope with p^rty S,\nwhich I decided to send that way to Wild Horse Creek in the Rocky\nMountains and thence to the \"Kootanie Plain\" or the westerly end of the\n\"Howse Pass\" as circumstances might shew to be most advisable. Mr.\nMcLennan, Mr. Watt and Mr. Selwyn with their parties and also my party\nT went on to Yale and thence to Kamloops, where I arranged to join them\nas soon as I had seen my party S fairly off.\nFortunately on my arrival at Hope I found that the\nmule train I had arranged to purchase before I left Victoria\nfrom the Hudson's Bay Company, would be in town the following day.\nThe morning after my arrival I formed the camp and on the arrival of the\nanimals I took possession of them, but was again disappointed in getting\noff, as the packers in charge of the train would not enter our service owing\nto the distance we were going away from their homes ; I was therefore\nobliged to telegraph to N ew Westminster for others, and as soon as they\nreached Hope I put the train and cargo into order, and on the 31st July\ngot it and the whole of party S off, having arranged with the Engineer in\ncharge of the party that I would overtake the party before it reached Wild\nHorse Creek.\n,flK\nSB'\nWW\nill\nIt\n1\n'aw\nIP\nI;\nlft.\niii.;;.\nMB\nThe purchase of the above pack animals turned out to be a most fortunate investment, not only on account of the low rate at which I got them\nand the increase in the value of animals within a week after their purchase,\nowing to the demand for animals to convey freight into the Peace river\nmines but more especially as there were not any other trains on this route,\nand without them I should have been compelled to take the party via Yale,\nKamloops and Osoyons Lake, and thence by the same trail via Fort\nShepherd, which they followed, to Wild Horse Creek, which would have\ninvolved a heavy extra expenditure, an increased distance of over 200\nmiles travel and above all such a loss of time that it would have prevented\nthe party reaching the source of the Columbia river before winter set in.\nThe same day party H left Hope, I went by canoe to Yale and on\nreaching that town found Mr. Watt had been obliged to go on to Quesnel\nmouth, to see that party K'were provided with supplies and means of conveyance to get from that point to \"Tete Jaune Cache,\" owing to the above\nhe had not been able to arrange for various supplies, &c, which were to\nhave been purchased at Yale and forwarded to Kamloops; I therefore remained over a day at Yale and purchased and arranged for the forwarding\nto Kamloops, of a quantity of supplies for both Mr. McLennan's and my\nown party T. The following morning I went on as fast as possible on my\nway to Kamloops, but as a letter from Mr. McLennian reached me on the\nroad stating that he could not get the necessary pack animals for his sear-\nvice at Kamloops and requesting me to arrange for some beef cattle, I saw\none of the cattle owne^g on the Thompson river and purchased < 22 head to\nbe delivered at Kamloops in four days from the date of purchase. I after-\nWards found that I might have purchased cattle somewhat cheaper on the &\nThompson river but placed as I was, and not wishing our parties to be\ndelayed I could not run the risk of not having beef cattle on hand. I\nthen proceeded to the mouth of the Bonaparte river to try and purchase a\nmule train I heard of in that vicinity. I could not see the animals that day\nas they were in the mountains, but arranged to meet the mau in charge of\nthem some 15 miles further on the following day. When having seen the\nanimals I purchased them under agreement to be delivered to me together\nwith aparahoes and rigging at Savona's Ferry the next day. I reached\nSavona's Ferry the same evening, where I found my T party, a portion of\nMr. McLennan's and Mr. Selwyn's party. I had the bateau then at\nSavona's Ferry loaded with supplies for T\" party and gave orders for the\nwhole of that party to go on to Kamloops the following day. I then hired\na canoe and in company with Mr. Selwyn started for Kamloops which we\nreached the following morning, where we found Mr. McLennan very busy\npreparing for his trip up the north Thompson river. The next day, August\n7, I started the whole of party ^ with supplies, &c, by water for the westerly end of the Eagle Pass with instructions to push the survey through\nthat Pass to the \"Big Eddy\" on the Columbia river, and thence along the\nright bank of that river in the direction of the \" Boat Encampment,\" with\nthe utmost vigor. The result of their work you will find in detail on the\nplans and profiles and in the field books, diaries and reports of party T\nfurnished me by Mr. Mohan, Engineer in charge, which I now forward to\nyou. I sent Mi. A. S. Hall, Assistant Commissariat Officer, over by Seymour and G-old Greek with instructions to examine the country from\nFrench Creek to the mouth of the Blaeberry river, in order to ascertain if\nI could get animals over from La Porte, the head of steamboat navigation\nabove Colville, to the Howse Pass as it would greatly facilitate and cheapen\nthe conveyance of my supplies into that Pass. Mr. Hall was then to\nproceed to Wild Horse Creek and meet party Si and myself. I remained at\nKamloops until the 15th day of August assisting Mr. McLennan to get his\ntrains and parties off,- and then started with a few horses for Wild Horse\nCreek via Oolville. I was surprised to see the quantity of fine agricultural\nand pasture land along the Shuswap and Salmon rivers and in the vicinity\nof Great Okawagan Lake, many settlers have occupied land in this section\nof the country, since I was there in 1866, and goodwheat and other cereals\nof a very superior quality, and. vegetables that cannot be surpassed are\nnow grown there ; they also raise cattle and hogs, and with a market, of\nwhich they stand much in need, this portion of the Province would sustain\na large and prosperous agricultural population.\nAt Osoyons Lake I was detained two days making a contract with a\npacker to carry goods I intended to purchase at Oolville, from that place\nto Wild Horse Creek, and also to get two horses for my own use. I reached\nColville on the 27th August and arranged with Capt. AT Pugston,\nowner of the steamer \"49,\" to make atrip up to the \"Eddy with a\nload Of supplies for party * ; next day I went on about 16 miles to the\nAmeriean garrison and town of Colville where I purchased about 40,000\nlbs. of supplies, one half for the \u00bb and the other half for the 1' party. On\nthe 30th August I left Colville-and proceeded by the long and tedious trail- $0\nvia Spokane, Pend'Oreille Lake, and a porti6n of the Fort Shepherd trail\nto Wild Horse Creek, which I reached on the 13th September, having\novertaken the & party and train on the 11th. I found my party had to open\nthe trail for a distance of from 200 to 250 miles, as the old trail, which\nhad not been in use for three years, was blocked up with fallen timber\nand the fires that had swept over the country had burned up all the bridges\nand corduroys. Mr. Hall reached Wild Horse Creek the day before I got\nm. I here found the supplies you telegraphed to have forwarded to \" Fisher-\nville\" before I left Ottawa, ready for me, and a most fortunate thing it was\nthat they were sent on in advance, as it enabled me to set my train at work\nwith hardly any delay in conveying them to the \" Boat-Landing,\" which\nis situated on the right bank of the McGillivary branch of the Columbia\nabout 48 miles from its source.\nipt\n58!;}.\n\u25a0m\nim\ni>\nI remained at Wild Horse Creek until the 20th, and during my stav\nthere purchased some beef cattle, a small boat and canoe (the onlv ones I\ncould get) and various other supplies that would be needed to winter my\nparty on the Columbia river. The boat and canoe I sent up the Kootanie\nriver loaded with vegetables, and had them hauled over the Kootanie river\nand the Columbia Lake, I subsequently had the boat and canoe employed\nwith the other craft I picked up on the Columbia river in freighting my\nsupplies from the \" Boat Landing\" to the mouth of \" Howse Pass Partv\noiJPS1 \\he ?rst trai\u00bbload of supplies, reached the \" Boat Landing' on the\n27th September, and I at once sent the train back for other supplies to\nWild Horse Creek ; at this work the train was kept busy until winter set\nin. On my arrival at the \"Landing\" I was in a difficulty\nto get canoes and boats, but fortunately managed to ffet two\nold   canoes   from   the   Indians,   and   we   picked   up   two   bolts   that\n\u2022 \u2122S abando*ed. \\ or 8 Years ago. These boats I\nsaw m 1866 when exploring the Columbia River, for the Government of\nBritish Columbia. The boats and canoes although small, and in a verv\nunsound state, were of the greatest service to us, as without them we\nshould have been detained until we built some, as there is not any trail\nfrom the \"Boa Landing,\" down the Columbia River. Time7now\nwas most valuable to me, as everything indicated the rapid approach of\nwinter and I was most anxious to get over to the easterly end of mv\nDistrict on the North Saskatchewan River, before the snow fell. l\\ot mv\nparty and a portion of the supplies, down to the mouth of Blaeberry river on\nthe evening of the 2nd of October, but to my great disappointment found\nthere was not any feed for animals to be had\" I had sent;about 25 headof\nhorses down through the swamps and brush, that form a border to the\nSvlr+r Tr' fr\u00b0m the \"B\u00b0at Landing>\" to the mouth of the Blaeberrv\nriver ; these horses were to pack our supplies from the Columbia river to\nthe different depots I had decided to build in the Howse vZsandb few\nof them I intended to take with me across the Rock7 MotoiMns to ThT\nbXof\u00b0tnethC 7 T d\u00b0t*, ?T ^n\\e^iZdl^i, \u00a3?t^riZ\nbank of the Columbia, which is known in all our notes &c, as the \"Columbia River Depot.\" The next morning I set the whole party at work, to see if\nwe could get a trail opened to the mouth of the \" Kicking Horse River,\"\nin order to render it unnecessary for our boats and canoes to run the\nrapid water between the mouth of that river and our depot; we opened\nthe trail that day, for a distance of 2J miles, but found we would have to\ngive up the idea of a trail for the present, owing to the nature of the ground\nas more labor would be required to make it passable than we could spare.\nThe trail however, opened a large tract of land covered with good feed\nfor animals, which was very valuable, as it always enabled us to drive the\nhorses on it, when they came down to the depot. At the same time the\nparty were at work on the above trail, I examined and biased a line for\na trail from the depot to the Blaeberry river, (shown on our map of the\nHowse Pass) over a low spur of the mountains lying to the south of the\nI Howse Pass.\" I now set the party at work opening this trail, building\nthe various \" Depots,\" forwarding and storing the supplies in them, and\nrunning a Traverse and levels, along the Blaeberry river to the height of\nland between the head waters of the above river and those of the North\nSaskatchewan river, and taking three Indians and eight horses I pushed on\nahead to mark the line for the trail and make my way over to the \"Kootanie\nPlain.\" As the fresh snow was all the time accumulating on the mountain\ntops, and gradually getting lower and lower down their sides, it was a most\nanxious time for me, as I decided not to return until I had a look at the\nwhole of my district. I did not take any of my party, with the exception\nof the above Indians, as I did not want to endanger them, should the snow\nfall before I got back; and in all my mountain explorations I have found\nthat I can move much more rapidly when not encumbered with white\nmen. The Indian, also, when properly handled and made to feel that\nconfidence and trust is reposed in him, will work in all kinds of weather,\nand should supplies run short, on little or no food, without a murmur;\nnot so the generality of white men, particularly when working for a Government, although in justice I am bound to say that the white men, in\nboth my fe and T parties, could not have worked better or more faithfully\nthan they did, in all kinds of weather.\nBy chopping and hacking our way through the underbrush, and\njumping our horses over fallen timber, and incessantly wading up and\nacross the Blaeberry river, we reached the \" Summit Camp,\" which is\nabout one mile from the true height of land, on the evening of the\n17th of October. Here our troubles ceased, as we found excellent feed\nfor our nearly famished horses, and got clear of all the underbrush and\nfallen timber. The Indians now wished to return, as they thought the\nsnow might begin to fall at any moment, and cause us to lose our horses\n(three of the horses belonging to them) but as I calculated that I could\nreach the \" Kootanie Plain\" in about three days, I told them that I would\nonly travel three or four days more, and that if their horses were lost or\nleft behind I would replace them when I got back to the Columbia River, so\nthey went on willingly. I concluded that if the snow fell before I got back,\nto push on to the Rocky Mountain House and winter my horses there,\nand then make the journey back to the Columbia River on snow-shoes. I took several observations with Aneroid, Boiling Point and Thermometer, at the \" Summit Camp,\" and found my Aneroid had suffered a\nconsiderable derangement the day I reached the above camp. This I\nattribute to a fall I had with my horse of about twenty feet; as I was\nriding along a steep bank the soil gave way and we both rolled down into\nthe \" Blaeberry River,\" and as I fell against a tree the sudden jerk evidently knocked the delicate hand of the Barometer out of place. The\nproper note of this is made in my Table of Observations, so that the\nreadings from the \" Summit Camp\" can be calculated separately from\nthose made previous to the above accident.\nI Mm\nIII\n\\\\m\n11\nmm\nm\nMil\nm\nW\n|l!> 'i||\n:;..iyii\n\u25a0.;!|ii:.,:\nill\nli\nIiioat travelled on through the \"Blaeberry Nick\" for about half a mile,\nwhen we came to a number of springs which form the source of the \"Blaeberry river\" ; another half a mile brought me on to one of the streams that\nform the head waters of the \" North Saskatchewan river. \" There is but\nlittle difference in the level of the ground between the summit camp and\nthe waters of the North Saskatchewan where I first struck them. On\nreaching the last mentioned stream we followjd down the shingle flats\nthrough which it flows, and after passing a short canon where the cliffs on\neach side do not rise to any great height we emerged on the extensive\nshingle flats that sweep around the base of Mount Forbes, on its southerly\nand westerly sides. A larger fork of the North Saskatchewan river forms\na junction with the one We followed from the \"Height of Land\" in the\nthe \"Blaeberry Nick\" at a distance of about five miles from the \"summit\ncamp,\" the valley then takes a bend to the right and after passing through\na narrow opening with rocky banks we again came on a very extensive\nshingle flat which continues down to the stream that flows from \"Glacier\nLake.\" As the reports on the Eagle and Howse Passes, together with the\naccompanying Field Books, Journals, Plans and Profiles, &c, &c\u201e will give\nfull details, I shall not enter into them in this report. We camped among\nsome low sand hills nearly opposite to the opening through which the\nstream flows from \"Glacier Lake,\" We saw many tracks of the Elk, the\nCariboo, the Mountain Sheep, and G-oat, the Grizzly and Black Bear^and\nthe Panther. The night being clear and calm I walked out on the\nshingle flats for a mile or two to enjoy the grand and magnificent scenery\nwith which I was surrounded, but the unpleasant ery of a panther close to\nme was a hint that I had better get back to camp,\nfollowed the right bank of the river and at once struck upon\nand well beaten horse trail, seeing the remains of innumerable camps\nsome of which had evidently been occupied two or three days before our\narrival. We forded the \"Little North Fork\" of the Saskatchewan at a distance of about three miles from our last camp and when we had followed\nthe trail for about 10 or 11 miles we forded the main river to the left bank as\nthe ground on the right bank becomes broken and rugged and the trail is bad\nand but little used\u2014probably only travelled during high water when animals\ncannot ford. Immediately on reaching the left bank of the river we came\non a capital, well beaten and nearly level horse trail which we followed all\nthe way to the \"Kootihie Plain.\" I camped at a point I thought was about\n2 or 3 miles above the \"Kootanie Plain\" and the following day, October\nThe next morning we\na\ngood 19th, I travelled to the north easterly end of the Plain, then forded to the\nopposite bank and hunted in all directions in order to ascertain if any signs\nof the party in charge of my brother Frank could be found. As I was\nsatisfied they could not as yet have been to this point from the east (we\narranged to meet here before I left Ottawa) and as the winter was too close\nat hand for me to wait or go on to the \"Rocky Mountain House\" I r'ecrossed\nthe river to the left bank and when I got on the main trail picked out a\nconspicuous grove of firs on the trail in the middle of a prairie which we\nbiased and marked and then having deposited a letter for him I commenced\nmy return journey and reached my last night's camp where I staid. The\ntwo following days were occupied in returning to the \"Summit camp\" which\nI reached on Sunday the 22nd October at 2 p. m. The thermometer stood\nat 50 \u00b0 in the shade; the extraordinary warmth of the weather during my\ntrip through the valley of the Saskatchewan has quite astonished me and.\nI at this time concluded we must have had a very late and fine season. I\ntook a bath in the head waters of the Blaeberry river and found the water\nquite pleasant. After my return to the Columbia and Thompson rivers I\nfound from the miners and settlers that the winter had set in much earlier\nand with a greater degree of severity than any other of which they had\nany record.\nI was very much disappointed to find that my party had not as yet\nreached the \" bummit Camp\" so the following day 1 started down to meet\nthem; at a distance of two miles I met Messrs. Gillette and Rheaume,\nwho were running the levels, and they informed me the party were\ncamped about four miles farther down on \" Three Creek Flat,\" so I went\non there and camped. In the morning I had the party out cutting a\ntrail from Three Creek Flat up in the direction of Summit camp, and at\nthe same time I moved the camp up 2J miles, and instructed the party to\ncontinue next day at work opening the trail to the summit for our pack\nanimals as Mr. Gillette informed me he would have the trial levels to the\nheight of land completed by that time, and Mr. Green said the same with\nregard to the Traverse, both of which were fortunately accomplished.\nThe snow to-day, October 25th, fell on the river bottom, and everything\nlooked very wintry and miserable; however, 1 thought I might yet\nmanage to get the regular line of survey down from the summit, so I sent\nword for the whole party to meet me at the summit with their instruments &c, &c, ready to commence work in the morning. I found it had\nsnowed a good deal during the night, but I started up at daylight and\novertook my party just as they reached the Summit camp. There was now\neight inches of snow on the ground and it was snowing heavily, but\nthere was not any frost in the ground. We tried to commence the line but our\ninstruments got full of water and it was impossible to walk along the steep\nside hills with the new wet snow. I therefore gave orders for the party to\nreturn to camp, which we reached some time after dark. Seeing now\nthat it would be useless to endeavor to survey the line from the \" summit\"\nas both my party and horses would be endangered and the horses certainly\nlost as they had no feed, I decided to move down to our Depot No. 2 and\ntry and survey the line from this point down to the Columbia river.   I there- 34\n4m\nill\nMi-\nfore got all the party and horses down totihJat.station on the 30th @ofobeff,ibllHl\nwhen we got up the next morning we found the snow was fallowing.' racfc-\nand between daylight and 9 a. m., nine inches of snow fell. I now felt\nconvinced the Winter had fairly set in, so I reluctantly gave orders for tha-\nwhole party to make for the \" Columbia River Dep&t\" as fast as possible.\nI got in with some of the horses on the 3rd Novovember, and the rest of\nthe party and horses all got down by the 6th. I now set:'all hands at work\nbuilding houses to winter in, and my staff getting the plans and profiles\nready to take down with me. I also sent for Mr. Hall to come to the\n\" Depot\" at as early a date as he could, and get the remainder of our supplies down from \" The Boat Landing\" before the river got frozen up. In\nthis I was not successful as the first severe frost came on the 13th November, and stopped all further boating on the river. I now sent up the\nhorses to join the mule train which I gave orders should go into wiinfcer,\nquarters near the \" Boat Landing;\" and at the same time sent instructions\nfor Mr. Hall to come down with all the accounts, so that I could take them\nwith me to Victoria. Mr. Hall arrived on the 27th day of November, and\nhaving got everything in shape on the evening of the 3rd December, I\ngave my final- instructions to the party (a copy of which I have already\nforwarded to you) and on the 4th December commenced my journey down\nto Victoria with the intention of visiting party T on my way, and also exploring the Pass reported to exist through Selkirk Range between the head\nwaters of the Bushay and Gold rivers. After a long andmost difficult\njourney on snowshoes in the worst period of the year for travelling, as the snow was newly fafljejn, and the ice not safe, reached the\n\" Eddy\" on the 22nd day of December, where I found party T safe\nin their winter quartos. I found there was not any practicable pass,\nthrough the Selkirk range, as the sunjmit was. upwards of 6,000 feet\nabove the sea level\u20144,00ftjfeet of wh^ch a^jtude. is (gained in about five\nmiles\u2014and for several miles along the lowest portion of the Summit\nValley which lies between two ranges of mountains that rise from four to\nsix thousand feet higher thaniihe above valley, and from these mounting,\neven at the. early part of the winter, when I ciossed them, enormous avalanches had slid down with such force that in several instances the snow\nand ice of which they were composed was formed up the opposite side of\nthe valley to a height of from 1,000 to 2,000 feet.\nSi*\nI was detained at the \"Eddy\" six days waiting for the plans, profiles,\naccounts, &c, &c, *of party T, but on the 29th day of December I again;\nstarted on my downward journey through the Eagle Pass and via thecgreat\nShuswap lake and the river of the same name foic Kamloops which I\nreached on the 9th day of January. The journey through the Eagle Pass\nwas very difficult, as there was not snow enough to cover the dense underbrush and fallen timber which made it almost impossible in many places\nto use our snowshoes, and the; snow was so soft that walking without them\nwas extremely tedious and tiresome. The greatest depjbh of snow ini this\npass did not exceed two^eet when I passed over it. On my way to Kamloops I explored a pass from the north westerly end of the Salmon river\narm of the great-Shuswap lake>to a pointoppositedhe Islajad near the west '86\nend of the main arm of the same lake, this pass may be made available for\nthe line of railway should the route via Salmon river, explored by Mr. John\nTrutch last autumn, not be adopted.\nThe Eagle Pass derived its 'name from the following circumstances:\u2014\nIn the summer of 1865, I was exploring the Gold Range of mountains\nfor the Government of British Columbia, to see if there was any Pass\nthrough them. I arrived at the Eagle River, and on the top of a tree near\nits mouth, I saw a large nest full of eaglets, and the two old birds on a\nlimb of the same tree. I had nothing but a small revolver in the shape of\nfirearms; this I discharged 8 or 10 times at the nest, but could not knock\nit down. The two old birds after circling around the nest, flew up the\nvalley of the river; it struck me then, that if I followed them, I might\nfind the much wished for Pass. I explored the valley 2 or 3 weeks afterwards, and having been successful in finding a good Pass, I thought the\nmost appropriate name I could give it, was the \" Eagle Pass.\"\nI remained at Kamloops two days, settling a\u00abcounts with the Shuswap\nIndians I brought over with me, and. getting horses ready for my journey\nto Yale, and on the 21st day of January I reached New Westminster; by\nthe first Steamer I went over to Victoria, where I have since been preparing my accounts, plans, reports &c, and making preparations to have\neverything in shape for an early start in the Spring.\nThe \" Howse Pass District\" extending from the westerly end of the\n\" Eagle Pass,\" to the \" Eddy\" on the Columbia River, thence by the valley\nof that river, to the mouth of Blaeberry river, thence up Blaeberry river\nto the \" Height of Land \" in the Rocky Mountains, is covered with a dense\ngrowth of various kinds of timber, generally of a large size, and in most\nplaces, with a very thick undergrowth of different descriptions of shrubs\nand bushes-\u2014fallen timber also abounds, and from the above causes and\nthe difficulty of getting our supplies along without roads or trails, the\nprogress of the survey along this portion of the line, will necessarily be\nslow. From the Height of Land to within four miles of the Kootanie\nPlain, along the line the Railway will most probably run, is also generally\ncovered with a thick growth of Fir and Spruce, but not of large size.\nFrom the Height of Land eastward, along the valley of the North Saskatchewan, plenty of good feed for animals exists. From the same point\nwestward along the valley of the Blaeberry River, with the exception of a\nfew rushes, there is not any feed; but at our \" Columbia River Depot \"and\nthence -up to the \" Boat Landing,\" there is plenty of feed consisting principally of swamp grasses. At the latter point the bunch grass country is\nreached, which extends without a break as far south in the \"United States\nTerritory as I have been, viz., in Utah and Nevada and most probably\nmuch farther.\nThe general results of my seasonls work have been:\n1st. To run a traverse and levels through the Gold Range of moun- 36\n1$\n\u2022\u25a0\u25a0.)>\u2022;.\u25a0\nli-\niS?l\nfcfe\nArJ.\ntains uta the Eagle Pass, from Great Shuswap Lake to the Eddy, a distance\nof forty-four miles, which has satisfactorily shewn that a very favorable\nline for a Railway can be obtained through this pass. The highest point\nto be passed over, is 747 feet above Great Shuswap Lake, aud a regular\nand easy grade can be got to it, as the summit is 38 miles from that Lake.\n2nd. To run a trial line with traverse and levels along the Blaeberry\nriver, which flows through Howse Pass, from the Columbia River to the\nhead waters of the North Saskatchewan river, which shows conclusively\nthat a line for a railway can be got through the Rocky Mountains. The\nheight of land above the Columbia river at our depot, is 2470 feet.\n3rd. To explore the country from the height of land in the Rocky\nMountains, to the Kootanie Plain, by which I have ascertained that an\neasy line for a railway can be obtained all the way, with a light descending grade. The distance I estimate at about forty miles, and the difference\nof level, by means of observations made with Aneroid and Boiling point\nThermometer, at 355 feet.\n4th. To. build depots at various places in Howse Pass, and at the Eddy\nColumbia River, and store them with supplies, to enable my parties to\ncontinue the explorations during the winter, and to resume the instrumental survey early in the Spring.\n5th. To open about 300 miles of trail for pack animals, some of which\nI was on the old government trail between Fort Hope and. Kootanie, and\nthe rest through the Howse Pass.   All this work I was obliged to have\ndone in order to get my party to the Rocky Mountains.\n6th. To explore through the Selkirk range of mountains, from one of\nthe forks of Bushay river, to the waters of Gold river, where a pass was\nreported to exist, but which I consider quite impracticable for a railway,\nalthough a- pass might yet be found from another branch of the Bushay\nriver, to the head waters of Gold river, but I think the existence of a good\npass there is very doubtful.\n7th. To explore and find a pass connecting the westerly end of the\nSalmon river arm of the Great Shuswap Lake, with the westerly end\nof the main arm of the same Lake, and which might be adopted as I before\nobserved, for the line of railway, should the valley of the Salmon river\nnot be chosen.\nIt may, perhaps, be premature for me to point out some of the commercial advantages this line will have, but it is my belief that some of the\nprincipal ones (not taking a through traffic from China, Japan, &c, &c.\ninto consideration) are:\n1st. That the land suitable for agricultural settlement extends further\nwestward along the valley of the north Saskatchewan river than by any\nother route yet known, and there is an enormous tract of rich pasture\nland adjoining it. Coal, in large quantities, is also reported to exist as far\nup the river as the Rocky Mountain House. 2nd. That within a short distance from the point where agricultural\nland, east of the Rocky Mountains, ceases, the road would open a considerable tract of land suitable for settlement along the valley of the\nColumbia, south of our depot and extending down the Kootanie river ;\nit would also open up a country on this portion of the line, where much\nvaluable timber could be obtained that will be needed by settlers in the\nSaskatchewan valley.\n3rd. It would enable capitalists to develope the rich mineral resources\nof the Selkirk and Gold ranges of mountains, as both Placer mines, and\ngold bearing quartz of a very rich quality, are known to exist; the placer\nmines are now, to a small extent, worked at Wild Horse, Perry and French\ncreeks; and silver bearing rock of a superior description has been discovered in the Selkirk and Gold ranges. Qre from the Cherry Creek Silver\nmine, situated on the westerly slope of the Gold range, in the vicinitv of\nGreat Shuswap Lake, sold in San Francisco, when reduced to pulp, for\n|445\u2014gold\u2014per ton of 2,000 lbs.\n4th. Proceeding still farther westward as soon as the mineral ranges,\nabove referred to, are passed, the line would emerge into the agricultural\nand pasture region adjoiniug the Thompson, the Shuswap, the Spille-\nmee-chene and Salmon Rivers, and in the neighborhood of the Great\nOkanagan and Nicola lakes. Near the latter lake, I understand, coal of a\ngood quality was discovered last summer ; again, in p?ssing through the\nCascade range, it would run by the mineral region of the neighborhood\nof Fort Hope, where large bodies of silver ore exist. The valley of the\nFraser, from the vicinity of Fort Hope to the Pacific coast, contains an\nextensive tract of rich agricultural land which is generally covered with\na heavy growth of large and valuable timber.\nYou will thus observe that throughout nearly the whole length of\nthis line, either agricultural or mineral resources will always serve to\ncreate a large and profitable way traffic.\nI do not think that a shorter practicable line can be found, particularly if a good line could be obtained in a more direct course from the\nRocky Mountain House to Fort Ellice and thence to Fort Garry than by\nfollowing the valley of the north Saskatchewan by Forts Edmonton and\nPitt.\nThe late date at which I was able to get away from Victoria, the great\ndistance I had to take my parties and supplies into the interior, over a\nrough and comparatively unopened country, and the early date at which the\nwinter set in, have all tended to prevent as much progress being made in\nthe Exploratory Surveys in my District, as I should have wished; but\nthe general result is, that now there is a certainty of having a line for a\nrailway, from the Pacific Coast to the Valley of the North Saskatchewan;\nand it is my impression that the same difficulty, will not be experienced\non this line with regard to snow blockades as has just occurred on the\nUnion Pacific Railroad.\nI m\nI applied to the Government of British Columbia for reservations of\nthe ground around the \" Columbia River \" and \" Eddy \" depots, and they\nhave in each case made a reservation of 640 acres for the use of the\n^Railway.\nThe tables of meteorological observations, that I took during my trip,\nI forward to you, as they may be interesting to those taking an interest, in\nthe portions of country traversed by me; and I would suggest that the\nGovernment of the Dominion, furnish me with proper instruments to\nobtain a complete set of observations at three or four of my principal\ndepots, as I have a very good opportunity of having them taken, during\nthe progress of the surveys. These instruments should be forwarded\nwithout delay to Victoria, so that I could take them up with me.\nI may here mention, that the description given by Dr. Hector, of the\nportions of the couniry traversed by me, and that were formerly explored\nby him, when connected with Captain Palliser's Expedition, I found to be\nvery clear and accurate, and as I had his journal and reports always with\nme, I found them invaluable.\nThe accompanying accounts will shew you the gross expenditure in\nmy district, up to January 1st 1872, and the value of the supplies now in the\ndifferent depots for the use of the parties during the current year, and\nsuch .other details as will enable you to fully understand the financial\nposition of the district.\nI remain,\n:Sir,\nYour Obedient Servant.\nWALTER MOBERLY. *&smBmm'ti\u00a3ssBi w-o. m.\n(Progress Repor&of Exploration from Ydllow Head Pass westerly by the Cafri-\nboe District and by the North Thompson River, by R. McLennan, Esq.,\nin charge.)\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.\nSandford Fleming Esq,., )\nEngineer in Chief.)\nOttawa, 2Srd. March 1872.\nI respectfully submit the following report of my proceedings, and of\nthe progress made on that portion of the Survey in British Columbia, placed\nunder my charge in June last. In accordance with instructions, I proceeded\nto Toronto on the 20th of June, and remained there a couple of days,\narranging for the purchase of instruments and other requisites. On the\n22nd. accompanied by Mr. Walter Moberly C. E., Mr. George Watt, Commissariat Officer and others, left Toronto by rail, for San Francisco, and\narrived there on the 29th. At this place we had to await the sailing of\nthe Steamer for Victoria. This time was utilized in procuring instruments\n&c, which were not to be got in Toronto. On July 3rd we left by the\nSteamer Prince Alfred for Victoria and arrived there on the 9th; the\njourney from Toronto to Victoria occupied eighteen days. Immediately\nafter arrival at Victoria, commenced to organize parties, engage axemen\nand pack men, purchase supplies, and get all possible information about\nthe character of the country to be explored, and the best means of reaching\nit. On the 20th July, this work was so well advanced, that party K under\nthe charge of Mr. James A. Mahood, was able to leave for its destination.\nThe duty assigned to this party was the exploration of the country to the\neast of Tete Jaune Cache, on the most direct route to Quesnel Mouth.\nIt was first intended, that party 5?. should proceed by the following\nroute, viz:\u2014by Steamer to Yale, a distance of one hundred and eighty-\nfive miles, thence by Stage to Quesnel Mouth, three hundred miles,\nthence up the Fraser River to Tete Jaune Cache; the difficulty of getting\nboats at Quesnel Mouth, and the time that would elapse before they could\nbe got, together with fuller information subsequently received, regarding\nthe country lying easterly from Cariboo, to Tete Jaune Cache, induced a\nchange in the latter part of this route. This change was adopted, because\nthe people of Cariboo averred, that by passing eastward from that place to\nTete Jaune Cache, the journey could be made in twenty or twenty-five\ndays, and the exploration could be completed much more rapidly and\neconomically.\nAfter party *4 left I began the organization of party Q to explore for a\nline from Tete Juane Cache towards Clear Water, or Quesnel Lakes. It\nwas decided that this party should proceed by the North Thompson\nRiver, in order to ascertain the facilities the   country adjacent to, and 40\nm\n\u2022flvvs.\nm\nft\nIP\nIt\n\u25a0 especially west of the river, offered for approaching Tete Jaune Cache by\nrailway. Having partially organized this party, I left Victoria on the\n25th, accompanied by Mr. Moberly and the parties under his charge, and\nMr. Watt, and arrived at Yale on the 27th, where I overtook party B.\nFinding neither horses nor waggons could here be hired or purchased,\nfor the transport of party \u20acfc, Mr. F. W. Green was sent ahead by stage to\narrange for meals and lodgings, and the party started on the 28th to march\nto Fort Kamloops, a distance of one hundred and fifty-four miles. Expecting to be joined by Mr. Moberly, who had stopped at Hope to start a\nparty towards Howe's Pass; I remained at Yale till the 31st, and he not\nhaving arrived at this date, Mr. Watts and I proceeded by Stage to Fort\nKamloops. At Lytton, fifty-five miles from Yale, I overtook the party,\nmany of whom were now foot sore and lame, after engaging waggons to\ncarry those who were unable to walk, proceeded on my journey reaching Spences Bridge at midnight. Next morning left for Cache Creek, one\nhundred and ten miles from Yale, and arrived there in th 3 forenoon ; at this\nplace I left the stage, and continued the journey on horseback, the next\nmorning I left for Savonas ferry, and arrived there in the afternoon. Here\nI overtook Mr. Green, and about midnight, eight or nine of the party\narrived hungry and tired. Mr. Green was left at this place to forward,\nmen and supplies, as they arrived. On the morning of the 3rd August, I\nwith' seventeen men, took boat up Kamloops Lake, a distance of twenty-\ntwo miles to the Fort of that name, and arrived there in the afternoon.\nThe next day the men were allowed to rest, many of them being lame.\nm\n\u25a0A\n#:\n\u25a0\\\\rn-.\nM\nKM\n&\u201e\nII\nAugust 5th was spent in assorting^stores for shipment, in building a\nboat, and waiting for some horses purchased by Messrs. Moberly and\nWatt from the Hudson Bay Company, which came in on the 6th.\nSome of these horses were not able to pack and had to be rejected, and the\nsearch, in a sparsely settled country, for others to replace them, entailed a\nloss of time. Some of the outfit for packing was much worn and needed\nrepairs; the material for these repairs had to be got from Clinton, a distance of seventy miles, and blacksmiths to shoe the horses had to be\nbrought fifty miles. The scarcity of experienced men to drive the pack\nhorses was another difficulty, which, together with those before mentioned\ninvolved the outlay of a large sum of money and vexatious delays.\nAugust 5th, Mr. F. W. Green arrived with the last boatload of the first\nshipment of supplies, and next morning started with a party of twenty-\nseven, including staff, cook, axemen, and two Indians; he was also accompanied by James Jamieson and three assistants in charge of a pack\ntrain of forty horses.    For the purposes of supplying the men with fresh\njust arrived from Montana, I purchased eight mules, with outfit or apara-\njoes complete, for one hundred and fifty dollars per head, making Cooney's\ntrain, in all, thirty-three mules.   I also-agreed with the Mexican to carry 41\nfreight with thirty-one mules, 100 miles for three cents per lb., or one-hundred'and fifty miles for five cents, binding myself to pay him twenty-five\ndollars per day for demurrage should he be kept waiting for a trail. Having\nthus^ompleted the best possible arrangements for forwarding supplies by\npack trains, I dispatched two boats, laden with stores, to Clear Water, distant\nseventy miles from Kamloops, to be ready for the trains on their return.\nI also gave Mr. Watt a requisition for further supplies to be forwarded\nas far up stream as possible before the season closed. Mr. John McLennan,\nbrought by Mr. Moberly from Utah, because of his superior knowledge of\nthe river, was left at Kamloops to push forward the supplies to the party\non the North Thompson, and to party T, which went by Shuswap Lake to\nEagle Pass.\nOn the 18th August I left Kamloops with the train of the Mexican,\nMichael Carencio, instructing C. T. Cooney to follow as soon as he could get\nready. On the evening of the 19th I overtook Mr. Green and party\nabout forty two miles from Kamloops, and as he expressed fears about the\nability of some of the horses to finish the journey, I wrote Mr. John\nMcLennan instructing him to purchase and forward to packer Jamieson\nten horses as speedily as possible. In order to accelerate the movements of\nthe party I took the best of Jamieson's horses to pack tents blankets and\nsome stores, which was found to work well. Instead of finding as was anticipated a fair trail for one hundred and twenty miles from this point, the\nparty had here to begin clearing it out. The next day Assiniboine Bluff\nwas reached and a day spent in making about a quarter of mile of trail, part\nof which ascended 70 feet per 100 horizontal; the greater part of a day was\nconsumed in getting the advance train over this place. From this point the\nopening of the trail on the east side of the river was continued until the\n25th August, when a crossing was made to the right or west bank at the\nhead of boat navigation, one mile above the mouth of Clear Water river.\nIt was decided to established a depot at this point, and a house built here\nby a Canadian trapper was utilized for a store house. Mr. lohn Glassey\nwas left as depot clerk, and Thomas Ekman to boat the stores across, as\nfast as they were brought up by the pack trains. The cutting of the trail\nwas continued and a place marked \"Meadows\" on Mr. Trutch's map was\nreached on the 31st August. The Mexican Carencio, having at this point\naccomplished one hundred and fifty miles refused longer to continue his\ncontract for packing. Having no other available means of transport I was\ncompelled to purchase his train, and pay him and his men wages; under\nthe new arrangement he agreed to remain as long and go as far as any\nof the other trains. At this place a new difficulty arose, the Indian guide\nbrought by Mr. Selwyn from Kamloops maintained that at this advanced\nseason it would be impossible to cut the way through along the river, he\nprofessed a thorough knowledge of the country, and said that between this\nplace and Blue river there were many canons which would render trail\nmaking very difficult and tedious, he also added that for forty miles of the\ndistance, there was little or no grass, which would necessarily very much\nreduce the pack trains if it did not prove destructive to them all. It was\nafter consultation decided to return about six miles and ascend the mountain II\n.-.\u2022'\u25a0iv.\non the left by the valley of Mad river, this route it was said would pass\nthrough an open bunch grass country to the mouth of Blue river. On the\nfollowing day (September 1st) the mountain was recrossed and on returning to Mad river Mr. John McLennan was met bringing up ten horses to\nreplace some that were worn out which he took back. By this route the\ntop of the mountain was reached in six miles from the Thompson river.\nThis trail was in many places 6,000 feet above the sea level, or nearly\n3000 feet above where it left the river, though a little shorter than by the\nriver it afforded neither the facilities for travelling nor grazing that was\nanticipated. On the 13th of September, after travelling thirty four milejs,\nthe river was again reached about three miles below the mouth of Blue\nriver, the rate of travel being less than three miles per day. From this place\nI sent C. T. Cooney back to Clear Water for additional supplies, dividing his\nload between packers Jamieson and Carencio, and instructing them to work\nup alternately so as to keep all the supplies as near the party as possible.\nHere additional difficulties were encountered, the underbrush was dense,\nand enormous fallen cedars strewed the ground and lay heaped together\nsometimes half a dozen on a spot. The ground naturally damp had by the\nincessant rains been converted into a quagmire, even gravelly hill sides\nbecame almost impassible when travelled over. It was most difficult to\nmake a trail at all, and in places it was impossible to pass until the trail\nwas either bridged or a corduroy road made of it. It now became a question whether under the adverse circumstances the journey could be continued to the main stream at the mouth of the Albreda river, distant about\n30 miles. Some of the packers were discontented and strongly expressed\ntheir desire to return, the cold rains and muddy or boggy ro'aSs were\ntelling fearfully on the animals, and it was evident that most of them would\nsoon have to succumb; assuring the men with the hope that I firmly believed\na better country would soon be reached, I decided to push on even at the\nsacrifice of all the pack horses and mules, rather than the expedition should\nbe prolonged for another season. The hope, and the promise to be allowed\nto return when the difficulty was overcome, seemed to inspire the men with\nnew courage, and the river was reached opposite the mouth of the Albreda.\nA detention of two days occured here in making canoes to ferry the men\nand stores to the east side of the Thompson river. On the 5th of October\nthe party crossed the Thompson and started along the righttbank of the\nAlbreda, the travelling some days being as bad as on the other side of the\nriver, with but little prospect of improvement. On the 9th, Mr. Selwyn\nkindly volunteered to make a vigorous effort to reach Tete Jaune Cache,\nto ascertain if Mr. Mahood had arrived there from Cariboo, while I continued to cut the trail and push through with the trains*?c\nil:\nOn the 10th the head of Albreda Lake was reached, the country here\nwas entirely different from that through which the party had been passing for some weeks, which had a re-animating effect upon all. Following\na comparatively open valley running in a north-westerly direction, the party,\non the thirteenth of October, reached Canoe River, about two and a half\nmiles above its confluence with the main stream. Mr. Selwyn was here\nmet on his return from T6te Jaune Cache, he having found no trace of 43\neither Mr. Mahood or his party. As timber for building purposes or fuel\nwas scarce at this point, it was thought advisable to return to a dense\nclump of fir trees about seven miles back, where water was also convenient and establish the winter camp. As the hills on either side of us were\nnow covered with snow, arrangements were made for the return of the\npackers at the earliest moment. An examination of the stores on hand made\nit apparent that to provide against want until the return of the supply trains\nin June, 1872, it would be necessary to reduce the party to thirteen all told.\nAfter consulting with Mr. Green, and deciding upon the disposition to be\nmade of the party, I determined, if it was possible, to make my own way to,\nor through the Leather Pass. Messrs. Selwyn, Hammond and Baltzby of the\nGeological Survey, proposed to accompany me. The party left Canoe\nRiver on the 16th of October and arrived at Moose Lake on the 19th. The\nmost of the route to T6te Jaune Cache was fair, the only obstacles being\nfallen timber. From the crossing of the Fraser RiVer at the Cache to\nMoose Lake, fallen trees, occasional bogs and gravelly benches interrupted\nour progress. As the horses were now showing symptoms of succumbing\nto over-work, the question of returning was discussed, and it was decided\nto continue the journey another day. Next morning the party travelled\nalong the margin of the lake to its east end\u2014a distance of about 14 miles\u2014\nhere the character of the valley and stream greatly changed, the stream\nbeing about forty feet wide, and sluggish; the valley was about a\nmile in width, very flat, and in most places too soft for horses to\ntravel over; it was dotted with small meadows, and timbered with\nstunted spruce trees. Although very desirous of advancing farther, it\nwas unanimously decided not to do so, as it was felt the stock of\nprovisions was barely sufficient to take the party to its starting point.\nOn the 21st the return began, and Canoe River was reached on the\n24th; the estimated distance travelled by the party in nine days being\nabout ninety miles. On the 26th October, accompanied by Mr, Selwyn\nand party, I left Mr. Green's camp for the Thompson River crossing '\nwhich was reached on the 28th. Here it was decided to go down the\nriver, and as some canoes had to be made, it was the 2nd November before\nthe party left; in two days the head of the rapids was reached. For nine\nmiles from this point the canoes had to be lowered by ropes, one of the\nportages was three quarters of a mile long, three hundred feet above\nthe level of the water, and took nearly two days to cross it. 1 ravelling six days at the rate of a mile and a half a day, Salmon River\nwas passed, after which there was an unobstructed passage lor\ntwelve miles. At the confluence of Mad River with the Thompson one\ncanoe was lost, we were compelled to abandon another, and to tache the\nphotographic instruments; the provisions, clothing, papef and notes oi\nthe party were placed in the two remaining canoes, m charge of tne Indians while the other members walked by the trail to the depot at Clear\nWater which was reached on the 14th of November. The party arrived at\nKamloops the following day simultaneously with some packers and axemen who had left the camp at Canoe River some seven days earlf&\\\nThese men came by the trail and suffered severely ; on their journey they-\nhadbeen compelled to abandon many horses and mules that gave out on tne 44\nway. At Kamloops all the men were discharged except C. T. Cooney, packer,\nand one or two axemen, who were retained to tend the horses and mules\nas they came out during the winter. The rest of the party I brought\nwith me to Cache Creek on the Cariboo Road, and distant from Yale one\nhundred and ten miles. At this place I learned from \" Davis,\" one of the\npackers of Mr. Mahood's party who had just come down from it, that it\nwould be impossible for me, so late in the season, to reach the party.\nUnder these circumstances, and thinking I might hear from \" Mahood \"\non my arrival at Victoria, I abandoned the idea of joining him, continued\nthe journey to Victoria, and arrived there on the 4th December. After\narrival, the remainder of the men were discharged except W. N. Patterson, transitman, and C. L. Howse, store-keeper, who were retained to\ndo office work, and adjust some accounts connected with the survey.\nM*\nfcfiM\nM'\nHaving given an outline of the purposes of the expedition, and some\nof the difficulties met with, I shall now submit a short description of the\nprincipal features of the Thompson River and its valley, between Kamloops and Yellow Head Pass.\nKAMLOOPS  TO  ST.  JOSEPH,  47  MILES.\nValley from two to four miles wide.    The river between the above\nnamed   places passes between two rocky points,  each about one mile\nlong; soil chiefly good for farming purposes, thinly wooded with fir trees,\nwith little underbrush; bunch grass is abundant; stream navigable for\n.joats of two or three tons or small steamers.\nST. JOSEPH TO CLEAR WATER,  23 MILES.\nft\nValley about two miles wide, much of which is suitable for Agriculture; the Assinniboine Bluff (slate rock) is in this section;  woods of fir;\nsmall steamers.\nriver navigable for boats or\nft\nCLEAR WATER TO  MAD RIVER,  26 MILES.\nI\n1, .\u25a0!\nI\nValley about \u00a3 mile wide for about 2 miles; then widens out gradually\nfor four miles to Raft River where it is about 1\u00a3 miles wide, it again narrows to J mile at Mad River, which is the limit of Bunch grass. This\nvalley is formed of high gravelly benches, timbered with fir, poplar and\ncotton-wood; stream rapid, and not well adapted for boating or canoeing *\n\u00ab\u2022.\nMAD RIVER TO.SALMON RIVER,  25  MILES.\nFor about six miles the valley attains a width of half-a-mile, and at nine\nmiles, is only a quarter mile wide, and continues about this width for\nabout six miles, it then expands abruptly to two miles wide, and maintains this width for ten miles, or to Salmon river, near which are laro-e\nmeadows of wild hay, the valley is composed of benches from one hundred\niv two hundred feet high in the  narrow portion,   and   flattened   out in the wide part. The stream in this section, is a succession of rapids\nand smooth water, the former predominating for about fifteen miles,\nthence to Salmon River is smooth water, and the river in places 300 yards\nwide.\nSALMON RIVER  TO  BLUE  RIVER,   25  MILES.\nFor about 9 miles the river is a continuous rapid, with three canons\nwith falls of 6, 12 and 8 feet, after which the stream is swift water for\nabout six miles (the north arm of the Murchison rapids) thence for ten\nmiles a few slight rapids, and the rest smooth water; timber, chiefly large\ncedars and hemlocks; the valley about 300 yards wide is formed of benches,\n100 to 200 feet high, the canons are hemmed in by slate rock about 100\nfeet high, and nearly perpendicular, averaging from 50 to 75 feet wide, and\nin the aggregate, about one mile long; the greater portion along these\nrapids being rock; from the head of the rapids to Blue river, or about 10\nmiles the valley widens out to from 3 to 4 miles, with alluvial banks four\nto five feet above high water.\nBLUE  RIVER  TO  NORTH  FORK  (RIVER  CROSSING)   30  MILES.\nIn about five miles the valley closes into \u00a3 mile in width, and from\nhere to the North Fork continues about the same; the banks are chiefly\ngravelly benches with a few slides of talcose slate; timber mostly enormous\ncedar, spruce and fir, with dense undergrowth, this section is well\nadapted for canoeing, and is interrupted only by one portage of about half\na mile in length.\nNORTH FORK TO ALBREDA LAKE, 12 MILES.\nThis valley is about half-a-mile in width and formed of gravelly\nbenches about fifty feet high, interspersed with flats or wild meadows,\nheavily timbered with cedars and spruce.\nALBREDA LAKE TO FORKS OF CANOE RIVER, 10 MILES.\nValley from | to f of a mile wide, open country, chiefly burnt land,\ncomposed of benches of small boulders with a few rocky points of granite\nand sandstone.\nCANOE RIVER TO TETE JAWNE CACHE, 13 MILES.\nA fine open valley 5 miles wide, with sand benches on the sides, thinly\ntimbered with small firs and willows, and directly in the range of an\nextensive valley, beginning at the Boat encampment, and extending in\nnearly a direct line for thirty miles down the Fraser River valley, or a\ntotal distance of from 75 to 80 miles; a fine farming country, pea vines,\nvetches and grass abounding. 46\ni\n|ir;\n\u00a7\u25a0\n3\u00bb;\nTETE JAUNE CACHE TO MOOSE LAKE, 24 MILES.\nThis Valley is about J mile wide for 10 miles to the Grand Forks\nof the Fraser, it then increases in width, and is full of limestone pebbles,\nthe valley has high gravelly benches, with a few points of calcareous\nslate rock; from this point it narrows for about two miles, and slides\nof shale come in some places close to the water's edge, with a slope of 1J\nhorizontal to 1 perpendicular, thence it expands to about a mile in width\nat the west end of Moose Lake, and is timbered with fir, spruce and\ncedar.\nMOOSE LAKE TOWARDS COW DUNG LAKE, 14 MILES.\nThe valley for 6 miles along the north side of the lake, is flat, about\n200 yards in width. Thence to the east end of the lake, or for two miles\nsome slate rock points approach near to the lake; beyond these are large\nmeadows of wild hay ; thence for six or seven miles the valley diminishes\nin width, from 1| to 1 mile, is quite flat and boggy, and interspersed with\na number of small meadows; is wooded with firs and spruce. The stream\nis sluggish, and from the west end of the lake, is very favorable for\nboating.\n$\nI:\nW\nI shall now proceed to give an epitome of the progress of party R\nunder the charge of James A. Mahood. This party was assigned the duty\nof exploring the country, between Quesnel Mouth and Tete Jaune Cache\nby the Fraser River route.\nThe difficulty of getting boats, and the loss of time, that must in consequence have occurred at Quesnel Mouth, together with the favourable\nreport of Messrs. Black and Fenton, and other information gathered at\nCariboo, regarding the country between Richfield and T6te Jaune Cache,\ncaused the abandonment of the route by the Fraser River and the adoption of the exploration via Richfield and Tete Jaune Cache.\nThe party\u2014twenty-two men, staff included\u2014left Barkerville on the\n23rd August, taking along to carry supplies, a pack train of thirty-two\nanimals; in addition to which Messrs. Barns & Black were engaged for\nthe same purpose, these parties possessing the only pack train in that\nsection of the country.\nFrom Barkerville to Bear Lake, twenty-two miles\u2014an old trail had to\nbe partially opened\u2014this route was selected instead of the one by Antler\nCreek, because it was thought to afford better facilities for the passage of\ntrains.\nFrom Bear Lake the party proceeded to Mian Point Lake, thence 47\naround the north and east side of Big Lake to its outlet, thence up Swamp\nRiver through \" Dominion Pass\" to its head, thence by the Castle River\ntowards Fraser River. In the report of Messrs. Black and Fenton reference is made to Dominion Pass.\nFrom Bear Lake to Dominion Pass the difficulties of trail making\nwere very great; the greater part of the distance was through a dense forest,\nin some places the trail had to be corduroyed, in other places a passage\nfor the animals had to be made by pick and shovel on the rocky hill sides;\nmountain torrents and ravines had to be spanned by bridges. Pushing\nalong, despite the innumerable difficulties that beset the way, the party\nreached the hoped-for pass, which high and glacier-capped, towered up\nin front of them, as if to crush out hope and defy further progress. For\nthe animals a passage over it had to be cut with picks and axes, and on the\n29th of September the party emerged from Dominion Pass. At this point the\npackers became afraid of being cut off by snows, and threathened to desert\nthe stores and return to Cariboo. Fortunately they were persuaded to\nremain, otherwise the effort to reach the valley of the Fraser River must\nhave-been abandoned. The progress of the party was now much impeded\nby snow storms which were almost continuous from the 5th to the 10th of\nOctober. The Fraser River was eventually reached on the 20th of November,\nand the party encamped for the winter. After making the best possible\ndisposition of the supplies, Mr. Mahood started for Barkerville on the 4th of\nDecember, which was distant one hundred miles, and arrived there in\ntwelve days; from thence he continued his journey to Victoria, where he\narrived on the 12th of January 1872..\nThis route presents two almost insurmountable obstacles to the construction of a railway. The country from Fraser river at Quesnel, Mouth\nto the Dominion Pass, could be traversed at easy grades\u2014that portion\nIvans between Big Lake and Swamp river, would be exposed to isnow\nslide's or avalanches that in their courses irresistibly sweep rocks and trees\nbefore them, and make as it were a series of avenues through the forest, on\nthe mountain slopes. In going from the forks of Swamp river over the\nPass into the head waters of Castle river, a rise and fall of two thousand\nthree hundred feet has to be overcome in a distance of twelve miles. The\nglacier previously referred to is at the highest pomt-is half a mile m\nixtent and about two hundred feet thick. To grade np to, or overlhis\nglacier would be an impossibility, its passage would therefore mvolye^e\nmaking of a tunnel of such length, as to render this route unworthy of\nfurthe? consideration. Mr. Mahood and party before leaving then: winter\nquarters will make further explorations to ascertain | a practicable pass\ncan befound through the Selkirk range. They wiU also explore the\ncountry between Quesnel Lake and the Cariboo fork of the North Thompson\nRiver.\nThe route from the Yellow Head Pass, crossing Canoe river by\nAlbreda Lake, thence along the valley of the north Thompson River is\nsingularly favorable for the construction of a line of railway, oi easy 48\nIII\ngradients, and moderate curves, and in addition comparatively light\nwork (see table of grades, of the different sections of those streams.) On\nthis line no grades will exceed fifty feet per mile, and for great distances\nwill range from fifteen to twenty five feet per mile, which will allow for\nsome undulations in rising or falling, to follow the benches or terraces in\nthe different valleys. In many places stone for second class masonry is\nplentiful, and I have no doubt but further examinations will lead to the\ndiscovery of stone of a better quality, and the finest and largest timber in\nthe interior of British Columbia, abounds along these valleys. The parallels\ninclosed in the foregoing report, embrace a very large portion of the\nfarming and grazing lands of British Columbia, pass near to, or through\nparts of the richest gold regions, as well as the best timbered, portions of\nthe interior, in the latter of which the Thompson River undoubtedly excels.\nFrom the best information I could obtain, the present winter set in\nearlier and with greater rigor than it did for more than ten years before. I\nhave lately been informed that Indian hunters say they never saw or\nheard of such a winter; this, though an impediment to our operations\nand fatal to many of our pack animals, must still be accepted, as in some\ndegree, a fortunate circumstance, it enabled us, in the outset, to acquire a\nknowledge of the most severe weather likely to be experienced. The\nparties are instructed to note particularly the maximum and minimum\ntemperature, the depth of snow at the water sheds, and all necessary information bearing on the subject.\nAccompanying this report please find tables of the inclinations of the\ndifferent sections of the streams on the route of my explorations. These\nwill indicate, approximately, the gradients; an actual line may, however\nshew a lighter grade from the Grand Forks of the Fraser River to Moose\nLake; on the whole, this line throughout, will be one of easy grades.\nI have herein endeavored briefly to give you the salient points of the\nexplorations, and I entertain the belief that a more detailed examination\nnow being carried on, will corroborate what has been said.\nReferring to a previous statement where it was said the severity of\nthe winter had been fatal to the animals of the pack trains, I may in connection therewith, say, that the total loss was 86 animals 24 of these\nbelonged to party U, and the remainder to party <|. Many died on the\noutward journey from cold, hunger, or overwork in travelling over a country\nwhich the incessant rains had made almost impassable, the majoritv\nhowever, were either abandoned or perished in the snow storms, which\nwere almost continuous on the home journey. In prosecuting the work\nanother season, the trains will, in a great measure, be exempt from losses\nthat this summer were unavoidable. A good trail is now opened, and the\ngrazing grounds are better known, so that the movement of trains\nWill be greatly facilitated, and the work finished earlier in' the season.\nI may add that supplies, nearly sufficient for two parties for ten months'\nare stored on the route, depots being established at Clear Water, 70 miles\nabove Kamloops, at North Forks, 176 miles from the latter place, and at 49\nMr. Green's camp, Canoe River. It is intended to make the North Thompson the principal base of supplies for the summer operations, as from T6te\nJaune Cache, supplies can be distributed toward Quesnel Lake\u2014if a pass\nis found there\u2014down the Fraser River or along the Thompson.\nIt gives me pleasure to be able to state that good feeling generally\nprevailed among the staff and men of both parties. The inclemency 01\nthe weather, the density of the forests to be penetrated, and the character\nof the country travelled over, entailed hardships not usually endured on\nrailway surveys. Nothwithstanding these and the other difficulties of the\nservice, the \" esprit de corps\" of the parties, except in one or two instances\nwas excellent thronghout.\nI have the honour to be\nYour obedient Servant,\nR.

P. R.\n&'i Ottawa, April, 1872.\nSib,\u2014In accordance with instructions received from you in June last,\nI proceeded as rapidly as possible to Fort G-arry, where I completed'm^f\noutfit and commenced the exploration on the 4th August, following as near\nas possible the redone indicated on the map accompanying your instructions,\nalong the Assiniboine to FortPelly then past north side of QuilLake across\nsouth SaskatehewihiiSPlaUilud58 N. 52\u00b0 22' 12,\" thence west to the north Saskatchewan which we followed to a point about sixty miles above Battle river.\nA westerly course was then taken to the Hay lakes, we then left the line and\nproceeded northerly to Edmonton, where we arrived on the 16th Oct. The\nfollowing notes are extracts from the diary kept on this portion of the line :\n\" From Fort G-arry to third crossing of White Mud river (Palestine) a distance of 96 miles, the country is a perfectly even prairie' with no large\nstreams or gullies, soil rich, clay and clay loam; there is some fine oak.\nelm, maple and poplar.\nFrom third crossing of White Mud to the Little Saskatchewan, a distance\nof 49 miles, the rise to second Prairie Steppe (or Riding Mountains) is\nmade ; the country is very much broken by sand and gravel ridges and is\nthickly wooded with small poplar.\nThe Little Saskatchewan valley is the first obstacle of any importance\nit is 5,000 feet wide, 184 feet deep and has no lateral valleys of any length!\nFrom Little Saskatchewan to Bird Tail creek, a distance of 58 miles\ncountry is rather rolling with small alkaline ponds in hollows, soil gravelly'.\nThe valley of Bird Tail creek is 3400 feet- wide, and 140 feet deep\nit also has lateral gullies. '\nFrom Bird Tail creek to Shell river, a distance of 38 miles, the country\nis rolling, getting rougher as you go back from Assiniboine; there are also\ngreat numbers of small lakes and ponds, plenty of small poplar, soil clay\nand gravel The valley of Shell river is 3700 feet wideband is 284\nfeet in depth and would be very difficult to cross. From Shell river to\nFort Pelly a distance of 73 miles, the country is rolling and there are two\nsmall creek valleys and a couple of swamps to cross, the soil % generally\n\u2022aft teto m        nei\u00abhWhood of Pelly. \u2122ry sandy.   Some small spruce 51\nThe country from White Mud river to Fort Pelly is not favorable for\nsetltemelit, the soil being generally light, a good deal of the water alkaline,\nsummer frosts frequent.\nFrom Fort Pelly to south Saskatchewan, a distance df 226. miles, the\ncountry is rather rolling until we approach the.river, where for 25 or 30\nmiles, a succession of ridges rise to about 80 or 100 feet, but these\nhave easy slopes and numbers of openings: on this part of the line we\npassed severallarge lakes, thelafgestbeifj%\\\u00a3uill lake, whreh8^ from 30 to\n35 miles in length; and the water is so alkaline as to be unfit for use. Soil\nis principally clay and. sandy loam with great numbers of boulders ; the\nwater in all the running streams is invariably fresh and good; very little\ntimber.\nA comparatively easy crossing of the south Saskatchewan was found\nat Lat. 52\u00b0 22' 12\" at this point the approach to the river is easy and frjqm 50\nto 60 feet above the level of the water which at mid-stream was about ten\nfeet deep. The bridges will probably require to be 1400 feet long ; banks\nand bottom are sand mixed with large gravel and boulders.\nAfter crossing the south. Saskatchewan, we continued on a westerly\ncourse to the elbow of the north Saskatchewan, passing it on j&e sora&eisly\nbank. From south Branch to Eagle creek, a distance of 47 miles, the\ncountry is perfectly level, with no timber, soil sandy loam : Eagle creek\ncan be crossed easily near its mouth.\nFrom Eagle creek to Battle river, a distance of 50 miles, the lin^runs\nalong north end of Eagle hills^ there is, however, a plateau which follows\nthe river and affords a good chance for location, except for about six miles\nwhich will have to be on steep side hill.\nAt the mouth of Battle river there is a fiat which is about 5 miles long\nand about 1 mile in width, and is 12 or 15 feet above the river giving a\ncapital chance to cross it. The river was only 75 feet wide when we crossed and did not show signs of being subject to heavy floods. Soil sandy\nloam with gravel in places and a good many sand hills near the mouth.\nThere is plenty of birch and poplar on the Eagle hills.\nFrom Battle river, for a distance of 64 miles, no difficulties will be met\nwith.  Soil principally sandy loam, with some sand knolls. No timber.\nFrom the above point for a distance of 84 miles the country is cut up,\nin every direction by ranges of hills and buttes, the highest points being\nprobably 300 or 400 feet above general level, there are plenty of lojr\ndivides in all the higher ranges, and I think it would not be necessftry to\nuse any grade exceeding 50 or 60.feet per mile on this portion of the fine ;\nalthough it will necessarily be rather crooked. Soil clay and sandy loam\nwith gravel ridges and a great many boulders ; not much wood and a great\nwant of water. 52\nFor a distance of 63 miles to foot of Beaver hill, nearly a level plain,\nno obstruction; soil exceedingly fine, sandy loam, plenty of good water^\nand small timber.\nFrom foot of the Beaver hills to Hay lakes, a distance of 20 miles, the\ncountry is cut up by low ridges with a great number of Beaver ponds and\nmarshes in hollows.    It is also thickly covered with small bushy poplar.\nThe rise to the top of the hills is long and very gentle.\"\nP\nill\nlm\ntiJafii?\n\u25a0;i\nT-t\nUfa*-1\nIII\nI\ni3\u00abs*l.:\nirm.fi.-'\nOn reaching Edmonton,   as the season\ncharge of the main\nwas so far advanced, I concluded to send Mr. Nichol back in charge of the main party, hoping that\nhorses would reach Fort G-arry before winter, at the same time giving\nhim instructions to proceed along north bank of Saskatchewan to Carleton\nand to examine the country in that direction, then to follow the cart road to\"\nQuill lake : at the latter point he was to divide his party sending one portion in charge of Mr. Ermatinger to Fort G-arry by the south bank of Assiniboine, and taking charge of the other portion himself, to cross by a depression in the Duck Mountains and examine the country lying to the\nnorth of Duck and Riding Mountains as far as mouth of White Mud river.\nThe fire having run through the prairie late in the fall this party lost\na number of their horses, it being impossible to get any fo od for them.\nImmediately after Mr. Nichol left I started for the Howse Pass, having\nto take the route by the Rocky Mountain House and then follow the Saskatchewan into the Mountains I reached the Kootanie Plains on the 11th\nNovember. After searching without success for traces of the party from\nthe west of the Mountains I explored the country lying between the\nKootanie Plain and the branches of Brazeau river leading between the\nBrazeau and Big Horn ranges of mountains where I found there would be\nlittle difficulty in locating a line, the fall of the streams being very gentle,\nhowever after reaching the main stream of the Brazeau river considerable\ndifficulty would I think be met, as the valley is very crooked with high precipitous banks and besides which a very broken and rugged country\ncovered in many places by large and deep muskegs would have to be\ncrossed and great difficulty would also be experienced in either getting\nround or through the Brazeau mountains: I gained a good deal of information respecting the country from miners who had been along the river\nprospecting and my own observations confirmed what I then learnt.\n>WtW\nOn reaching the main branch I found it would be impossible to follow\nit ^without cutting a trail on account of an almost continuous windfall, by\nthis time the snow was nearly a foot deep and as our horses were beginning to show signs of giving out I was compelled to return to the Rocky\nMountain House, whence after procuring a train of dogs I set off for Buck\nlake intending to examine the country between it and the mouth of Brazeau river. We were however misled by our guide and finally had to\npush on'to Edmonton for supplies arriving there on the 11th December,\nflaying been six days on very shortjrations. 58\nOn the 20th December after dividing the party and sending part in\ncharge of Mr. Horetzki, to make the necessary examinations to Jasper House,\nI again started for the mouth of Brazeau river examining country from the\nBeaver hills by way of Pigeon and Bull lakes, reaching that point on the\n29th December. This part of the country I found pretty level except two or\nthree small ranges of hills in the neighbourhood of the lakes. In the portion\nlying to south-west and west of Pigeon lake there is a very considerable\nquantity of good spruce.\nOn reaching the junction of Brazeau and Saskatchewan rivers, I found\nthat it would be an exceedingly difficult matter to get a line across the\nSaskatchewan and up the Brazeau river as they both run through wide\nvalleys with precipitous banks of sandstone from 150 to 200 feet in height\nwith flats alternately on each side and opposite these the banks generally\nrise tc their full height from the waters edge.\nI then returned to Edmonton by way of Lake St. Ann, and found\nthat between those points an excellent line can be.obtained by following the\nvalley of Sturgeon River.\nOf the country between Lake St. Ann and Jasper House-, I copy the\nfollowing from Mr. Horetzski's report:\u2014\n\" From Lake St. Ann to Pembina River, the country is level but\nknolly in places, especially at west end of Lac des Isles, here the land\nrises, but not abruptly, to the summit of the divide between the Saskatchewan and-McKenzie Rivers j this divide is 250 feet above the level of\nEdmonton House. The descent from this point to the river is pretty\nsudden. The Pembina River valley is rather deep and wide at the crossing\nof the Horse trail, but higher up there are many places where it can be easily\nbridged. At the crossing the river is 225 feet wide, fordable, with good\nbottom; extensive coal seams crop out sometimes near the water's edge\nand again higher up on the banks; these seams are on fire in several\nplaces, and flames can be seen at night, the odour of burning coal is distinctly perceived.\nFrom Pembina River to McLeod River it is generally level, and in\nplaces swampy; at the divide between the two rivers, the country becomes hilly and rough, especially near Moose Camp.\nA couple of miles west of Moose River the trail crosses the Root\nRiver, a small tributary of the McLeod. From this point a good horse\ntrail exists to Jasper House. My guide tells me it is almost a direct fine\nfor the south end of Lac Brule, passes over a sandy country, crosses only\ntwo small swamps and the McLeod River twice, and is altogether an\nexcellent road. No hills are to be met with and the descent to the river is\ngradual and easy.\nThe Company's trail follows up the River for 83 miles, then crosses a\n1 flip\n#4\nHP\n*'j-\nPortage of 12 miles in length, follows the McLeod again for 14 miles, and\nfinally takes the Portage to the Aihabasca, which is about 13 miles in\nlength.\nThe McLeod is a pretty large stream from 240 to 270 feet wide in\nplaces, and flows between Sandstone banks; these banks are often 80 to\n100 feet in height. This River is fordable in places, and contains G-old.\nNo coal was seen.\njw\u00bb;\u00a3i'i\nIf\n.(\u2022lis*\n,;\u25a0.;,:>\u25a0\u25a0'\nw\nj. jfe .\nIf'\nm\nFrom the McLeod to the Athabasca, the portage is pretty thickly\nwooded and rough; the descent to the Athabasca river is steep : I should,\nsay the descent of the valley to be 250 feet deep, where we struck the river.\nFrom the Portage (5 miles below the Grand Bas fonds,) the river was\nfollowed for 25 miles to the entrance of Lac Brule'; the river is wide and\nrapid, being from 160 to 420ft. in width. Several rapids are met with,\nespecially a few miles below the Lake; the banks are high, and the approach\nto the river difficult, excepting just below the Riviere de Prairie, where the\nbanks descend very gradually. This Lake is about 8 miles in length, and\n1 mile wide; it is shallow with sandy bottom, the banks on the eastern\nside are low, 30 to 40 ft., and of sand; at the South East end, these banks\ndescend very easily to the water's edge, and it is at this point that the road\nalluded to before, touches the Athabasca. The Lake terminates here, and\nthis may be called the entrance of the Mountains, the Athabasca here\nturns to the South West, and by following it up ten miles further, Jasper\nHouse is reached.\nAt the base of the mountains there is a fine wide level flat of light\nsandy soil, where the road can easily be carried to a point or spur of the\nRoche a Miette, here the river would have to be crossed as the rock is\nwashed by the river ; the true channel is not wide at this point (about 210\nfeet) but the river bed cannot be less than 750 wide,' all dry at this time\nof the year with the exception of the channel, and has a good hard\ngravelly bottom; after crossing to the other side, a fine level prairie is\nreached, being that upon which Jasper House is situated.\nDuring the summer months the river rises 5 or 6 feet higher than at\nthis season, but never overflows the prairie on which the house stands, or\ntne \u00b1Jas londs which lies along base of mountains.\nI should advise that an explorer be sent next summer to go over the\ncountry lying between the Pembina and Root River ; that another should\ncommence his investigations from Root River to Lac Brule \u2022 the\nperson going mat the Pembina should begin, say 8 to 10 miles above the\nusual crossing place and follow up the ridge which runs from the Pembina\nto the height of land between that river and the McLeod. I believe thesp\nridges offer a good route for a railway; south of it, I am told the\ncountry is a vast swamp. ne As regards that part of the proposed route between Root River and\nLac Brule, I am convinced that it presents extraordinary facilities for a\nroad.''\nAll the necessary explorations to the west of Edmonton, except that\nentrusted to Mr. Horetzki, having been completed, I started on my return\ntrip to Fort G-arry, on the 16th January, by way of Lac la Biche, a point;\nabout 100 miles north of the north Saskatchewan; then to Fort Pitt,\nCarlton, Fort a la Corne and Fort Pelly.\nIn order to gain as much knowledge as possible of the country along\nthe valley of the Swan river and extending east of the Duck and Riding\nmountains, I started from Fort Pelly for Swan Lake and then proceeded\nalong the side of Lake Winnepegosis to Manitoba House, and arrived at\nFort G-arry on the 10th March.\nMr. Nichol having had the most favorable opportunity of examining\nthe line between Edmonton and Carlton north of the river, I will give\nthe following extracts from his notes :\u2014\n\" The country lying north of the North Saskatchewan and east from\nEdmonton to the Yermilion River, a distance of 37 miles, is almost level,\nit is thickly timbered in places, with spruce, poplar, and birch of a good\nquality ; the soil is a black sandy loam, it is drained by the Sturgeon and\nYerrHflion rivers, emptying into the Saskatchewan ; these streams are about\n50 feet wide, clear and rapid, with gravel bottoms; the valleys are from\n50 to 75 feet under the general level and are about 500 feet wide.\n\" The country from Yermilion River to English River, a distance of\n182 miles, is all broken by hills rising from 100 to 200 feet on an average,\nand in the neighbood of Fort Pitt the Red Deer Hills are from 400 to 500\nfeet high; there are numerous small lakes, the largest of which are Saddle and Egg lakes ; in the immediate vicinity of the lakes the country is\nflat, extending back for a few miles; the soil on the hills is light sand and\ngravel, and in the valleys sandy loam ; there are great numbers of limestone and granite boulders near the English River; there are groves of\nsmall poplar on this part of the line, and on the banks of streams some\nspruce is found ; this part of the country is drained by flowing creeks and-*\nrivers ; Carp creek 30 feet wide, and its valley 50 feet deep and 500 feet wide ijl.\nRound Butte creek about the same size; White Mud river 50 feet wide .\nvalley from 75 to 100 feet deep, and half a mile in width ; Saddle river is 60,\nfeet wide, and its banks only a few feet high; Dog Rump creek 30 feet wide,\nwest bank steep and over 150 feet high, east bank an easy slope, the distance across valley is about one mile; Moose creek 20 feet wide, the\nvalley banks steep and from 150 to 175 feet high, width half ;a mile; Middle\ncreek same size as Moose creek; Red Deer river 25 feet wide and run-;\nning in a fine broad valley on west side of the Red Deer hills; English\nRiver 15 feet wide, very crooked, winding round among the hills in a\nnarrow valley. 56\nm\nm\nIP\nl!|\nMm\nill\n\u00a7\nill\n'IS\nlis\nIff\nill\n1\u00a7\n'Pf\nW\n\u25a0X-W\n' Vwfn\nFrom English River to Carlton, a distance of 128 miles, the country is\nbroken by ranges of hills from 150 to 200 feet high, with broad and nearly\nlevel valleys between them ; soil in valleys sandy loam, the only timber\nis some small groves of poplar.\nIn the thickwood hills, from 20 to 40 miles west of Carlton, there are\nnumerous small lakes, the largest having an approximate area of 35 square\nmiles; the width of the Saskatchewan at Carlton is 1,200 feet, the valley is\na mile wide with steep banks about 200 feet high.\"\nFrom Carlton I had an opportunity of examining the river for myself\nas far as Fort a la Corne, but did not succeed in finding any favourable place\nto cross, the valley being very similar to that already described at the\nmouth of Brazeau River, except that no rock is visible in the banks.\nFrom Fort a la Corne to Fort Pelly, the country is thickly wooded and\nrolling in places, but no obstacles of importance are met with.. From the\nlevel of Fort Pelly there is no difficulty in descending by the valley of\nSwan River to the low ground east of the Duck Mountains; From Swan\nriver, the country lying north of Duck and Riding mountains, was found,\non examination, to be nearly level, thickly wooded-with spruce, poplar,\nand some maple, a few small lakes and marshes were also found;\nsoil, sandy loam, and admirably fitted for farming.\nMr. Ermatihger's examination from Touchwood Hills to Fort Ellice\nand Souris River, shewed that the bridging of all the streams in that\ndirection would be very great, and there would be no advantage gained\nby carrying the railway along the general direction of the Assinniboine.\nG-enerally speaking the country extending from about Fort Pelly by\nSwan River, and between the Riding Mountains and Lake Manitoba, to\nPrairie Portage near Fort G-arry, is for the mosf part well wooded and the\nsoil of excellent quality.\nHaving now completed a general examination of the several routes\nindicated by you, I am satisfied from what I have seen and learned, that the\nmost eligible route for a railway Will be found to extend from Fort G-arry\nto the north of Duck Mountains, passing between the Thunder and\nPorcupine Hills, crossing the south Saskatchewan in latitude 52\u00b0 22' 12\",\nand following south bank of north Saskatchewan to a point about 60 miles\nabove the mouth of Battle River, thence by way of Beaver Lakes, Edmonton, and Lake St. Ann's to Jasper House ; by taking this line the bridging\nof the wide and deep valleys running back from the Assinniboine, and of\nwhich I have furnished sections, would be avoided, and both branches of\nthe Saskatchewan would be crossed at the most favourable points known,\nthe rough country lying to the north of the North Saskatchewan, and east\nof Edmonton, would also be avoided, besides which the line would pass\nthrough a larger portion of country favourable for settlement, than other\nprojected lines. 51\nThe only timber of much value is spruce which is found in groves\nalong the flats of the North Saskatchewan west of longitude 112\u00b0 and about\nthe Pigeon and Buck lakes, and from-Carlton House downwards, but the\nquantity is greatly lessened, each year by the prairie fires spreading into the\nthickwoods.\nI send herewith samples of grain, &c, raised at different points on the\nSaskatchewan each labelled with the name of the settlement at which it\nwas procured, and also specimens of coal and gold from Edmonton. Coal\nis seen on the banks of the Saskatchewan from Edmonton to Rocky Mountain House, the seams vary in thickness from two to nine feet.\nWhen the location surveys are commenced it will be necessary to open\na trail or cart road along the north side of Duck and Ryangmountainsand\nas far down as Quill lake, and also to improve the trail from lake St. Ann's\nto Jasper House.\nOne of the principal feature of the lakes along' the Saskatchewan are\nthe immense numbers of white fish in them, which* although of a smaller\nsize than those caught in lakes Huron and Superior, are equally good in\nflavor; at lake St. Ann's 200,000 have been taken in a season, and at Pigeon\nLake 100,000 have been taken in the same period, these are two dr the\nprincipal fisheries.\nThe country lying westward from the Forks of the Saskatchewan to\nEdmonton and from the Battle River, north to the Pelican Lake, and Lac\nla Biche; and also the couijttry lying adjacent to the Red Deer\nRiver, is nearly ail admirably adapted for agricultural purposes; and\nalthough the portions now under cultivation, are invariably the low and\nsour flats along the rivers and lakes, I have seen some very fine crops\nof Wheat, BarLay and Potatoes, and am convinced that if the Uplands were\nused the results would be still more favorable.\nThe total distance travelled in the country west of Fort Garry, was;\n5,900 miles, and it was my special object, to avoid travelling over the\nsame road twice, in order to gain as much information as possible respecting the Country.\nI am pretty thoroughly convinced, that Surveying Parties carrying on\ntheir work in the ordinary way, would meet with no opposition from the\nIndians along the route.\nI must also mention that we would have suffered very great inconvenience, but for the kindness experienced at the hands of the Officers of\nthe Hudson's Bay Company, who did everything in their power to assist us.\nIn conclusion, I must thank Mr. Nichol, Mr. Horetzki, and Mr. Er-\nmatinger for their able assistance in carrying out your instructions, and\nfor the willing and cheerful manner in which they endured the many\nhardships we had to encounter.\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour most Obdt.

R.,\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to submit the following report, in reference to\nthat portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway Survey, extending from\nMattawa to Red River, a distance of about 900 miles, which you were\npleased to entrust to me.\nThree parties (B. C and !*.) under Messrs. Lloyd, O'Hanly and Austin,\nwho were charged with the duty of exploring northward and westward\nfiom Mattawa, for a distance of about 250 miles, left Ottawa and ascended\nthe Ottawa river to the point named, on the 10th of June last. I started\non the evening of the 15th with a portion of the staff of the other eight\nparties (iE. to If. inclusive) for Toronto, where *the remainder were instructed to meet me, and arriving there on the afternoon of the 16th was\njoined by the rest of the staff.\nThe remainder of that day was spent in organization, arranging commissariat matters and procuring some men. On the morning of the 17th\nI sent off a portion of the staff and men to Collingwood, the remainder in\nthe afternoon, while I remained in Toronto until Monday, the 19th, (arranging various details with Mr. Wallace, the head of the Commissariat)\nthen started for the same place and arriving there that evening found the\nEngineers, in obedience to my instructions, had been hireing Axe and Packmen for their respective parties. It was found, however, impossible to\nobtain either the* large number or class of men required, and. many of those\nwe were obliged to take, subsequent events proved, were unequal to the\nvery arduous labor they had to undergo, causing very considerable\ndelay and difficulty in pushing on the work.\nTuesday, the 20th of June, the steamer Algoma arrived from Thunder\nBay, and the afternoon was spent in getting the supplies on board of her\nand the Rescue, one of the Government gun boats which had been obtained\nfrom the Militia Department, for the purpose of landing some of the parties\non the north shore of Lake Superior, at points where it was thought the\nmail steamer would not call. As the time drew near for the boat to leave,\nit was found that the carrying capacity oi the G-un boat was much less than\nhad been anticipated, the consequence was that most of the men had to be\ntaken on board the Algoma; the larger portion of the stores for Michipi-\nooton, Pic and Nepigon beinj placed on boaard the fbnaer. 59\nOwing to the great addition thus made to the usual number of travellers\non the Mail steamer, great crowding and inconvenience was experienced.\nThe Algoma started from Collingwood at 9:30 p. m., on the 20th of\nJune, the Rescue following shortly afterwards, and arrived at the Sault\nSte. Marie, on the 22nd of June, at 11 a. m.\nFearing that it would be difficult if not impossible to obtain canoes of\nthe requisite size and in sufficient numbers, at the points where they would\nbe required, I endeavoured to procure some at Collingwood and every\npoint where the steamer stopped, and by this means obtained seven before\nreaching Michipicoton on Lake Superior. It was fortunate that 1 had taken\nthis precaution, for none were to be had at the H. B. Posts, where we afterwards made our depots, as they never keep a stock on hand; to obtain\nthem it would be necessary to give the order a year before, in order that the\nIndians might have time to procure bark from the interior of the country.\nLeaving the Sault in the afternoon of the same day, we arrived off Mi\"\nchipicoton, on Lake Superior, at 8 o'clock, on the morning of the 23rd, we\nhad utilized the time occupied in coming here, in getting the supplies for\neach,party collected together, this, owing to the hurried manner in which\nthey had been put on board and the crowded state of the boat, as already\nexplained, was a work of great difficulty.\nThere are no landing places for large craft at any point on the north\nshore of Lake Superior, consequently the two parties, (E. and'F.) in\ncharge of Messrs. G-amsby and McConnell, together with their stores, had\nto be landed in the steamer's boats and a bateau kindly lent for that purpose\nby Mr. Bell, the H. B. Co.'s officer at Michipicoton, the Rescue coming\nup shortly afterwards, commenced to land supplies in the same manner. I\nwent ashore with the parties and had a short interview with Mr. Bell, who\nkindly promised every assistance in his power to forward the undertaking,\nwhich promise he fulfilled. Owing to the exposed position of the place\nand anxiety on the part of the Captain to continue his trip, the length of\nmy stay was shorter than I could have wished. No canoes of the size\nrequired were here to be obtained, as it seemed extremely doubtful if any\ncould be procured. I left four, being all I could spare, of those I brought\nwith me. A larger number was, however, requisite for the expedition's\ntransport of the supplies.\nLeaving Michipicoton we steamed for Pic, which point we reached at\n2:30 a. m., on the 24th June, and proceeded to land party \u00bb, in charge of\nMr Armstrong, in the same manner as the others had been landed at Michipicoton- but the difficulties to be contended with here were even\ngreater than at the former place, as the position is much exposed to seas\nfrom the lake, and at that early hour (2:30 a. m.) it was quite dark. Ihe\nRescue came in sight just as day began to break and we were leaving.;\nThere were no canoes to be obtained so I gave the party the three\nremaining on board the Steamer. '{d\nLeaving Pic at day light we arrived at  Nepigon at 3 p. m. the tdM\n\\ eo\nmm\nI; Wm\n\\m\nday and landed party H in charge of Mr. Johnston ; most of their supplies\nbeing on board the Rescue, and the Algoma being able to come along side\nthe wharf, our detention here was short. There were no large canoes to\nbe obtained, but the distance from the landing place to the point where\nthe party were to commence work being comparatively short, they succeeded, with some trouble and delay, in getting their supplies up.\nThe Rescue was not in sight when we left for l3Jbunder Bay, at whieJL\npoint we arrived on the morning of the 25th of J$uae and immediately\ncommenced to land the men and supplies; this together with geiating the\nlatter ia\u00bbtri store and finding accommodation for the parties, (tents being on\nboard the Rescue) occupied the entire day.\nAs it was of the nt&t importance to ascertain at once, what canoes\neould be procured to convey to their destinations the men, anteE supplies of\nthe four parties, who were to explore the country between Nepigon atond\nRed River, I crossed the bay from Prince .Arthur's landing to the H. B. Post,\n(Fort William) early the followmg morning, and saw Mr. Mclntyre, the\nofficer in charge, who kindly promised me every assistance in procuring\nctfiioes and Indians to man them; to his kind assistance I was much\nindebted for success in these matters.\nffiSfi j\nFinding that it would take some days to get canoes ready, I returned\nto the Landing to make arrangements for forwarding the men and supplies\noyer a portion of the \"Dawson Route\" to Red River. During my absence\nat the Fort, the steamer Rescue arrived at the Landing, and the supplies,\ntents, &c, were being landed.\nAt this time I was met by a difficulty which retarded very materially\nthe progress of the work. Mr. Dawson, the Engineer in charge, under the\nDepartment of Public Works, of the route to Red River, was absent with\nMr. Simpson, arranging a treaty with the Indians, at Fort Francis. Owing\nto this, and the fact that all the available force on the route was engaged^\nin forwarding supplies for the use of the troops, about to return from Red\nRiver, and for immigrants proceeding to that point; we were unable\nto obtain waggons and horses to forward our supplies, except in detached\numbers and at different intervals of time, consequently it was the 5th July\nfore the first of our parties and the 15 th before the last had, left the\nuanding.\nII\niBSV\nOn the 27th June I had been to Fort William pushing forward the\nconstruction of canoes, engaging Indians, &c, and on mv return to the\nLanding in the afternoon, found the place in the greatest'state of confusion ; the fires, which had been raging in the woods for some time, fanned\nby a storm from the south-west, had extended to the G-oyernment Depot\nat this point; all the tents of our parties were levelled by the storm, and\nhad it not been for the active exertions of the heads of our parties, assisted\nby iho jnen, the whole of the Government property would have been\nOctroyed, the number of men on tbj> spot connoted ^ththe works being m\ntoo small to battle with the flames. Mr. L. Russell, Mr. Dawson**\nAssistant on the wotIs, returned this afternoon from Fort Francis and'\ninformed me that great damage had been done by the fire at various points\nalong the route ; he also stated that he thought it would be unsafe for our\nparties, especially for those going to the neighbourhood of the Lake of\nthe Woods, to enter the woods for some time or until an arrangement had\nbeen made with the Indians at Fort Francis.\no\nBy the close of the week we were all ready to start, and would have\npushed forward but for the reasons already given ; we continued, however, to pusji forward supplies as fast as means of transport were available,\nbut I kept all the parties (with the exception of a few men sent to take\ncare of the supplies at Kaministiquia Bridge and Shebandowan Lake) at\nthe Landing, it being cheaper to board them there, than further inland.\nThe time occupied in forwarding the supplies was utilized by the Engineers taking their respective parties into the woods, in the neighbourhood\nof the Landing, and practising them at the work they would have to\nperform when on the actual exploration.\nMost of the supplies for parties I and K, having been forwared to\nthe KaministiqTiia Bridge, I started three loaded canoes, manned by Indians, by the river for that point on the 1st of July, and on the 5th, party\nf\u00a3 in charge of Mr. Oarre, started to walk there at 3 a.m., the distaaee by\nthe \" Dawson Road\" being 21 miles-; on the morning of the 7th*rparty I\ni|i charge of Mr. J. Fleming, followed ; airiflmg there myself; in the afternoon I found the two parties and the Indians, who brought up the canoes,\nall euqamped. The following morning (8th July), five canoes loaded witi*<\nsupplies, twenty-two men, and twenty Indians, started for the Great Dog\nPortage, wheat\u00a9 the supplies were landed; afnd while the men were engaged an transporting them across, the Indians returned with the canoes\nfor the remainder of the supplies and parties. In this manner they\nmoved along until their destination (about 100 miles from the Landing)\nwas reached, so great, however, were the difficulties of transport encojttB-\ntered on the way, that it was the 37th of July before work was actually\nbegun.\nParties f and M. being now fairly under Weigh, I returned to the\nLanding to start the two remaining, (f* and M) in charge respectively of\nMessrs. James and Jarvis, to Shebandowaas Lake. This being effecte^-I ascended the Kamiaistiquia River to the head of the G-reait Dog Portage,\nWheid I found the reafc of the supplies; for parties t and K and the Commissariat officer, the Engineers having gone forward with the balance.\nHaving given final instructions to the Commissariat officeers, I returned to\nthe Bfcidge, andi from thence I took the '' Dawson Road\" to Shebandowan\nLake, aErimng at noon on the 18th;; here I found parties li aad M. encamped\nthey haying cffme thorough on foot from the Landing in two days, jjjbe\ndistance being 47 miles. After seeing ev&yrthing prepared for a stairt\nfrom that pointr*o soon as boats could be supplied by Mr. Dawson, I teft 62\nm\nShebandowan that evening and arrived at the Landing the following\nmorning, in time to take the steamer Chicora for Collingwood.\nOn the trip down the Lake we called at Nepigon (21st July] where I\nlearned that party Iff was making favourable progress; we reached Collingwood at 6 a.m., 24th July, and I arrived in Ottawa the evening of the\n26th. Here I reported myself to you, and having received instructions\nto keep four parties at work during the winter, returned to Toronto, met the\nCommissariat Officer, Mr. Wallace, and arranged that warm clothing, snow-\nshoes, additional blankets &c, should be procured, and forwarded for the use\nof these parties. From this gentleman I learned that during my absence at\nThunder Bay, one of the parties (O) north of Lake Superior, had lost most\nof their supplies by fire in the woods; steps were, consequently, taken to\nrepair this loss.\nI again sailed from Collingwood on the 10th August, and reached\nThunder Bay on the evening of the 14th; the Rescue had arrived the day\nprevious having delivered a second supply of necessaries at the depots on\nthe north shore of Lake Superior. By her I received the distressing intel-\nigence of the loss of some men, by fire in* the woods, belonging to party\nH ; this made me extremely anxions to visit that party and all the others\nalong the north shore. Finding that this could be effected more satisfactorily by taking the Rescue than by waiting for the regular line of steamers, (whose visits to the posts on the north shore, at this advanced season\nof the year were very irregular) I altered the arrangement, made at\nOttawa, of sending her home after this trip to Thunder Bay ; and arranged\nshe should take me to Nepigon, Pic, and Michipicoten, and after landing\nme at the latter place should then proceed to Collingwood and be paid off.\nBefore leaving Thunder Bay I learned, that owing to the great difficulty of getting in supplies for two parties, by the route thfey had to\nfollow, party 1 had removed to Nepigon at the- other end of their division;\nI also learned that party K had advanced some miles along their route, and\nfound the country generally favourable for Railway construction. I forwarded the instructions to M.j and M, in reference to their remaining out all\nwinter; when last heard from, they had not arrived at their starting point.\nLeaving Thunder Bay, in the Rescue, on the evening of the 16th\nAugust, I reached Nepigon the following morning and proceeded along\nthe explored line to the camp of party I, a distance of 10 miles. The\ncountry passed over thus far being comparatively level and of rather a\nswampy character, (except in the immediate neighborhood of Nepigon)\nthickly, but not heavily, wooded with Balsam, Spruce and Cedar.\nI returned to the Rescue the following day at noon, and proceeded\ndown Nepigon Bay to Jack Fish river, where we arrived at 6 p. m. At\nthis point party H had established a depot, thereby saving a portage of 14\nmiles along the line from Nepigon ; here the effects of the fire in the woods\nwere first seen by us, the timber and soil being completely burned up. 63\nTaking a man from the depot and two Indians I had brought with me\nfrom the Sault, I started along the line to visit the party j after proceeding\nabout 12 miles we met Mr. Johnson and three men returning to institute\na further search for the missing men.\n. It seems desirable that at this point I should give an account of the\ncircumstances connected with this event, in order to shew that no blame\ncan attach to any one in this matter, except the unfortunate men themselves :\u2014A party of seven men, two whites and five Indians, were detailed\nfrom party II to bringfor ward supplies from one depot to another, (and for this\npurpose had cut a trail by a shorter route than that followed by the surveyed\nline) while the main party were proceeding with the exploration : notwithstanding their having been repeatedly urged by Mr. Johnston to push\nahead and keep up with the rest of the party, they lagged behind.\nTheir non-appearance, after some days, excited anxiety on the part of Mr.\nJohnston, who thought they had deserted and returned to Nepigon ; he\ntherefore proceeded there himself in search of them, but found they had\nnot returned; then having fears for their safety, as the whole party had\non several occasions, very harrow escapes from the fires, he immediately\nreturned to the main party and sent his second in command with a number of men to search for the others. After an absence of five days\nthey returned, having made an extensive search and found one Indian in\na portion of the woods which had been burned over. He was lying on\nhis face with his shirt, which he had taken off, between it and the ground,\nplaced in that position to exclude the smoke from his lungs; he\nwas not burned, but had evidently died of suffocation caused by the\nsmoke. In a swamp near by were found six holes which had been excavated by the others, in order that by getting into them they might escape\nthe fire, but the smoke becoming too dense had driven them away and no\nfurther trace of them could be found. The most extraordinary point in the\nwhole sad event, being that all the supplies, together with their blankets and\nclothes, were found at the depot untouched by the fire.\nThe first party sent in search having made these discoveries, returned\nto Mr. Johnston, who,upon receipt of their report, had, when I met him,\nas aleady stated, started to make a final effort for finding some further\ntraces of them.\nWe therefore, with the men, returned and slept for the night at one\nof the now deserted depots to which the supplies were being brought\nwhen the catastrophe occurred. When the whole party were first encamped at this point they had a very narrow escape, the fire having\nburned to within one quarter of a mile of the camp, and then leaping\nover burned on again beyond, leaving it intact. Leaving Mr. Johnston,\nthe following morning, to prosecute the search (which, I subsequently\nlearned proved useless,) I returned to the Rescue and proceeded down the\nlake to Pic, where we arrived at 8 p. m. on the 20th August.\nThe progress of this party had been very tatisfactory, although the fill:\npi\nU\nw\nm\n0\nif;\n1\nfp-\nmi-\n$$$\n:#>\"\u25a0\n'IS:\nSt*\n\u25a0IP!*.\n111'\np\ncsnntiry passed o^er proved, for the most part, extremely rugged and\nbroken, in fact entirely impracticable for Railway; construction, the distance\nrun at the time of my vo^sr,bting about 30 miles.\nLanding at Pic with my canoe on the morning of the 21st August, I\nprfteured some Indians at the Hudson Bay Post and proceeded up the Pic\nriw, reaching theparting;point of party i* (a distance of 50 miles above\nthe mouth of th&jrijver) late in the afternoon of the following day.\nThis . was the point where the supplies were destroyed by fire\nreferred to in an earlier part of this report. The manner in which it\noccurred was, as follows :\u2014The depot was built on a narrow terrace of the\nriver? bank, 20 feet above the water, which is succeeded byyaflaoihfitr terrace\nof about the same height, immediately in rear of the depot. In tbj&\nbuildingsall the stores of the party were placed, with the exception of a\nsmall supply for immediate use in the camp about 10 miles distant. There\nwas a man in charge who slept in the building ; about daylight one\nmeining he was awakened by a loud roarings noise, hastily putting on his\nclothes, he ran out to see the cause and found the whole of the woods on\nthe Upper Plateau, in rear of the building, inrflames. The fire was caused\nby some Indians who had camped there, who, on levying at daylight*\nhad neglected to extinguish the fire by which they had cooked their\nbreakfast. The storekeeper had only time to roll some few barrels of\nfloujf(and pork down the bank into the rivers aj&d betake himself to a canoe,\nwhen the whole place was in flames.\nThe consequence of this was thfet, fortsome time the party was reduced\nto lr?5Wg on fish, y^ich they caught, and some flouskindly lent to them by\nthe H. B. officer at the Pic As, soon as possible, but not /an>til after some\ntime had ejjapsed, intelligence of the disaster was forwarded to Toronto\nand the loss made good with as little deljajy as possible.\nStarting from the Depot early on the 23rd August, with two Indians\nand one white man, to carry supplies and blankets, we reached the party\nin the forenoon of the 25 th, after a most fatiguing walk of 40 miles. I found\nthe work progressing', very favourably although the party had many hasd*\nships to contend with, being sometimes reduced to very strafg&ftened cjffH\ncumstances as regards food, in consequence of the loss of their supplies by\nfire^and the great difficulty of transporting them over the rugged country\nthey had traversed.\nAt the time I visited th& .party they wese supposed to be within 6 or 8\nmjies of Lou\u00ae lake, at which point Mr. Armstrong, the Engineer in charge,\nhad directed a depot to be made. It subsequenfly turned out that they\nhad 14 milesiof a mostidifficult county to pass through, which took so long\nto get over t&at for some days before reaching the depot they had nothing to\neat but a little flour and berries gathered on the hills.\nliTjfce greater pari, of the country explored was of the most barren and 65\nrugged description, traversed by high ranges of hills of primitive rock from\nwhich every vestige of vegetation had been removed by fire, and quite\nimpracticable for a Railway.\nLeaving the party (O) on the morning of the 26th I reached Pic on the\n29th, where we were detained on board the Rescue in consequence of a\nstorm, the steamer having to take shelter in the lea of an island at some\ndistance from the mouth of the river.\nOn the morning of the 31st, the weather having moderated to -some\nextent we sailed for Michipicoton, and arrived there in the evening, but,\nthe storm rising again, we were obliged to take shelter under G-ros Cap, a\npoint two miles distant from the mouth of the river. By the 3rd September the sea had gone down, and launching my canoe I paddled myself\nto Michipicoten, the steamer proceeding on her voyage to Collingwood.\nMr. Bell, the H. B. officer at this point, procured me with some difficulty,\nowing to most ofthem having gone to their hunting grounds, six Indians,\nwith whom I started on the morning of the 4th, by Michipicoton and\nMoose rivers for the depot of parties E and E on the latter river, and\ndistant from Michipicoton about 150 miles.. We arrived at the above\nnamed point on the morning of the 8th, where I found that owing to the\ngreat distance over which supplies had to be conveyed, the difficulties of\nthe route and scarcity of men, the party (E) were run very short of provisions : stopping therefore only long enough to write a line to Mr. G-amsby,\nEngineer in charge, I proceeded down Moose river with the intention of\nvisiting New Brunswick House (H. B. Post) and trying to hire some\nIndians.\nAs I camped at a portage on the night of the 8th September, I was\njoined by party JJ, under Mr. McKenzie, on their way homewards after\nhaving ascended the Ottawa river, descended the Abbitibbie to James'\nBay and ascended the Moose river to this point. From this gentleman I\nlearned that my visit to New Brunswick House would be useless, as when\nhe left it that morning, the H. B. Co. could hardly procure Indians to man\ntheir canoe, about to start for Michipicoton for winter supplies. I therefore, in company with party BT, the next morning, retraced my way to the\nDepot, and arriving there in the afternoon immediately despatched one of\nmy Indians with a note to Mr. G-amsby, requesting him to come and meet\nme at his 15 mile Depot. My object in doing this was to save time, it\nbeing very important that I should get back as quickly as possible to Michipicoton, and endeavour by some means to forward more su;- 'lies.\nMr. G-amsby joined me at the 15 mile Depot on the eveninb pi the\n11th, from him I learned that on two occasions they had been without\nmeat for some days: having received his report on the progress of the work\nand given him his instructions as to remaining out all winter, I started on\nmy return journey the following morning, to try and find the Commissar\nriat Officer, Mr. Price, who was charged with forwarding supplies for parties\nE and F, and at this time engaged in taking in supplies to the latter am.\nlast\n66\nIt.\nRiS?\n1\nSf*M\nst\u00abS\nHE\n\u00bb\nIt\nTO'*'\nI\n. party, by another route which saved considerable land carriage.

The Chicora cafl&d at Michipicoton, Pic, and Nepigon on hfi$ way up the lake, thus enabling hie to communicate with all our parties. By tBis means I learned, at M^clffippton,\nthat parties E and F, were progressing favourably; at PicM: found^iil-r.

When, however, I aomnannicated to them the instructions to remain out all winter, those ihat were to stay cheerfully\nundertook to endure the hardships of a winter expedition.\nArriyigrg, at Nepigon I found Mr. Johnson and party (hajs^gj^pmpkii^^fi\nthejjf.jWork), and took them on board, in order tl\\a\u00a3jthey might rejilHgL jjtftfc]\nOttawa.    I at the same time sent inst\u00a3uction\u00a7t;to Mr^ Joh^ FlemihgaoWi\nremain out all winter with his party, and informed him that the necessary\nwinter outfit would arrive by the next steamer.\n. When we reached Thunder Bay I sent Mr. Carre (K) 'In^ffifi&tftms 4$^\nthe^teame effect, and having arranged with the CommissaSiat Offic&'fir*\nthis point that the winter supplies should be sent in as quickly as pos^HSIS?\nI started for Lake of the Woods.

James and Jarvis, parties (L and Jff,)in getting to their stffiflSflg8^\npoint, which they only reached on the 21st August, over two months from\nthe date of their leaving Ottawa.\nIt being the 5th November when I reached Fort G/arry, I cHfUclBaWt 06\nIf\nlifflt\nffik*\nfeNvU'\nMr. Robson to endeavor to go to Nepigon, by way of Duluth, for the purpose of assisting Division f in getting their supplies forward during the\nwinter. Returning to the \"North West Angle\" with the view of\nagain endeavoring to reach White Fish Bay, I found the ice was not yet\nstrong enough, nor could I succeed in obtaining an Indian guide. After\nwaiting there some days with the above result, I was about to give up the\nattempt and return to Ottawa, when Mr. James and all the party JL arrived\nfrom White Fish Bay, having travelled on the ice.\nFrom him I learned that the men had refused to continue out any\nlonger, and after an unsuccessful attempt on my part to induce them to\ncontinue on the work, I took steps to forward them home, returned to\nFort G-arry to procure others, leaving Mr. James and his Staff at the\n\" Angle\" until I sent them out. 0\nWhile I was thus employed at Fort G-arry all the men, who had\nbeen engaged in Canada, belonging to party M, came in arid1 insisted\non returning home, I had therefore, at the same time, to find others to replace\nthem. This was a work of considerable difficulty but by the 16th December I had procured the requisite number, and arranged with Mr. Jones\n(sent up by you to attend to Commissariat and other matters at Fort G-arry)\nto forward them to the respective parties.\nli\nm\nLeaving Fort G-arry on the 17th December, I reached Toronto on the\n26th; during my stay at the former place the weather had been extremely\ncold, the thermometer, on one occasion, registering\u201436 \u00b0 in the month of\nNovember.\nOn the 26th February of this year I left Ottawa and ascended the\nOttawa River to the mouth of the Montreal, a distance of about 250 miles,\ntaking Mr. Austin and staff with me, to complete the survey of Division\nC, which had been abandoned by the first party sent out, in consequence\nof some difficulty occuring between the staff and men.\nm\nm\nHaving seen Mr. Austin's party started, and paid a visit to Mr.\nLloyd (B), who expected to complete his Division by the middle of\nApril, I returned to Ottawa to superintend the preparation of the Plans, &c,\nof the work already completed.\nA cause of considerable difficulty in carrying out this undertaking,\nhas been the obstacles which, prevented either frequent or regular communication between the head office, myself, and the parties on the work;\nwhen, ^however, an opportunity offered, a statement of the progress made\nwith aj-ough plan and section of the line, has been forwarded to me by\ntk\u00a9 aoveral Engineers, *>\nFrom the latest information thus received, the following summary of\nthe progress of the work, at the beginning of this month, has been prepared :\u2014\nDIVISION B.\nOn the 31st March, about 15 miles of the survey were unfinished, which\nthe Engineer, in charge hoped to finish by the 15th April, if the weathefc\nproved favourable.\nThe first 30 miles of the Division are represented as being quite\npracticable, but some unfavourable points occur on the remainder. The\ninformation obtained, however, warrants the belief that a favourable location can be found by making some deviations from the trial Survey Line.\nDIVISION C.\nThe first party sent out having failed to carry out their instructions,\nsteps have been taken to complete the exploration which, it is expected,\nwill be finished by the month of July.\nDIVISION B.\nThe exploration of this division was completed about the end of\nJanuary, and the field notes forwarded to this office.

E.,\nEngineer-in-Chief, C. P. R., Ottawa.\nSir,\u2014The accompanying informal copy of the Itinerary of the Expedition to James' Bay, under my charge, will, when supplemented by the\ntopographical map now in hand, illustrate to you the details of the season's work. Vou will thereby also learn the nature of the country passed\nthrough, as regards its soil, climate, timber, minerals, topographical\nfeatures, and general geological structure. On all these points I have been\nas explicit as possible ; and my object here is, to epitomize the whole, with\nthe view of lending, if not additional, at least more immediate value to\nthe season's work, by placing it within abstract compass.\nAccording to received instructions, I was charged with carefully\nexamining the country lying between the valley of the Ottawa, Lake\nSuperior, and the waters of Hudson's Bay, with reference to the points\nabove enumerated, commencing at the Montreal River, a tributary of the\nOttawa, following the course of the Abbitibbie river, through to James' Bay,\nand returning by the Moose and Michipicoton river to Lake Superior.\nIt may hardly be necessary here to state that, in approaching a country\nso densely wooded, the topographical engineer is liable to some difficulty\nin obtaining a key, capable of placing within his professional control so\nvast an area, covering as it does about 30,000 square miles. Aware of this,\nI first endeavored to direct attention to some leading physical feature,\nwhich happily presented itself in the great mountain chain, which, at a\ndepth and altitude in ore or less irregular, traverses the whole country from\nLabrador to the far West, and on which as a base the subsidiary triangle\nenclosed by the Abbitibbie and Moose rivers with the intermediate chain\nof lakes rests. In ascending the Ottawa river, this well defined chain of\nmountains follows its noith-east bank to the mouth of the Mattawa river\nthe valley of which extends up to Nipissing lake. From Mattawa, the\nOttawa leads the voyageur in his upward course in a north-westerly direction for about 80 miles to Matabichwan, where it receives from the southwest the waters of the Montreal and Mafabichwan rivers. Below and\nabove this point Temiscamingue lake, through which the waters of the\nOttawa flow, extends for a distance of about 70 miles. At about 60 miles\nup, it leaves the mountain range referred to, in a northerly direction,\nwidens, and becomes shallow at the head, where it receives the waters of\n10 74\nthe Ketacamna, Blanch, and Moose rivers, the latter bei^g a continuation of\nthe Ottawa. At its eastern side, and near the head, it also receives the\nOttawa river, at present the highest outlet from the lumbering districts\nenclosed in the bight of the Moose river.\nLying north of this curvilinear range of mountains, and approximately\nparalled to it, is the great water-shed, which is reached, after ascending\nthe \"fifteen\" rapids on the Moose river, by the chain of lakes peculiar to it\nand in which the Abbitibbie and Great Moose rivers take their rise, and\nwhich, after flowing northwards, join at \"The Mattawa,\" 20 miles south of\nthe apex of James' Bay, into which, finally, they discharge their party\ncoloured waters. The southern slope is drained by the Michipicoton and\nother streams which flow southwards through a mountainous and unproductive country into the great lakes, while the St. Lawrence receives the\nwaters of the south eastern slope, through the Ottawa river.\nIn connection with these general features I may state a fact, which,\nalthough well known to yourself, may not generally be understood. In\ncrossing the great water-shed, or \"height of land,\" twice, and on different\nmeridians, I remarked that, both it and the mountain range, each send out\nantler-like spurs\u2014those of the mountain chain losing themselves in the\ncomparatively level country to the north, while those of the water-shed\ncontain a similar feature, less marked no doubt, but not less real, as indicated\nby the courses of rivers and streams, and if accurately delineated would\nproduce a most remarkable contour.\nAs, regards general geological features, the country south and southeast of the \"height of land,\" and lying-all along those lakes which discharge\ninto the Ottawa and Michipicoton rivers, nearly all, if not all, is primary\nrock, composed of gneiss, granite, trap, and an undefinable micaceous\ngreenstone, consisting of laminae, more or less'irregular in thickness ; also,\nimmense quantities of ice drift of every conceivable variety of primary\nrocks. This greenstone is observable as far north as Abbitibbie lake, its\nsurface invariably denoting, the serrating action of former ages. For some\ndistance down the Abbitibbie river, rock of any kind seldom crops out in\nthe banks, except at portages>i until, atlat. 48\u00b0 44' 43\" N., primary rock and\nAbbitibbie clay give place to small but increasing quantities of magnesium\nlimestone, which, with large quantities of gypsum, appears to underlie the\nwhole country to the north-west of this point, on the Abbitibbie river, and\nto extend over an indefinite area north-west of the Moose river. Since my\nreturn I have given the details of this latter formation much study and reflection ; but I consider it would be rash to attempt to deliver any decided\nopinion on a question involving so much, until after consultation (as kindly\nsuggested by you) with some eminent G-eologist.\nThe highest lumbering districts observeable on the Ottawa, terminate\nat Lac des Quinze, at the head of the \"Fifteen Rapids ;\" from which point,\nand up to the \"height of land,\" the white pine gradually disappears, and\nis replaced with spruce, red pine, birch and poplar.    On, and beyond th\u00ab- 75\nWatershed, the forest is principally composed of spruce, poplar, white\nbireh, and cedar. It is notable however, that in all this portion of the\nHudson's Bay territories, the spruce is gradually giving place to the poplar,\nwhich no doubt indicates some change, local or general, on which it would\nbe useless here to speculate. The woods there are also very dense, and\nvary in weight of growth according to the quality and nature of the soil,\nwhich, although generally light is of fair quality, especially that resting on\nthe limestone foundation referred to. As a general rule the \"height of\nland\" and vicinity, as well as south of it, particularly in the Lake Superior\nregion, contain land of indifferent, although varied quality. This is\nespecially the case in the Abbitibbie district, which rests on a species of\nflight blue clay, which when dried, resembles common pipe-clay, and which\nimparts a white color to its lake and river for 300 miles to the sea. I found\nalso that this clay in minute drift, forms* the sub-strata of the alluvial\nislands (about 27 in> number) dotting the mouth of the Moose river, and,\nwhich the flow and ebb of the tide gives an excellent opportunity of\nobserving. Above \"the Mattawa,\" it is also perceivable to some slight\nextent in the banks of the Moose river, but disappears about 45 miles from\nthe sea, and about 35 miles below the north-eastern margin of the primary\nformation, or, what appears to be the ancient sea wall.\nThe principal rivers north of the great Watershed are shallow, and\nnot available for heavy craft. The Moose and Abbitibbie rivers,' however,\nadmit of navigation by the Hudson's Bay Company's boa/ts, of about 10\ntons, for nearly 100 miles up, but only during spring, arid sometimes up\ntill the 1st of July. The Abbitibbie is remarkable for the regularity ol\nits width, and also for the singularly definite nature of its traverse angles,\nas well as for the uniform length of its traverse course while its descent\nis characterized by a series of rapids, (34 in number) the last and most\ndangerous of which occurs at its junction with the Moose river. On the\nother hand, the Moose is comparatively straight, but irregular in its width\nfor sixty miles from the sea, and has no portage for 120 miles up, being a\ngradual current; after which it becomes in most places, up to the line of\nthe Canadian Pacific Railroad survey very serpentine. For variety of rock\nespecially below New Brunswick House, both at portages and in drift, it\nsurpasses anything conceivable. Its quartz is pure and almost endless in\nquantity, containing apparent traces of gold, copper, &c, while galena is\nto be found in its \" south branch.\" There are also what appears to me\nindications of petrolium on its western side for about 30 miles southwards\nfrom tide mark; this locality also abounds with ferruginous and brackish\nspring's.\nFollowing up the Moose river to Lat. 48\u00b0 44' 30\" N., where it is crossed\nby the Paoific Railroad survey now in progress, the general country is very\nreo-uhvr and offers every facility for roads and railroads; immediately south\n<of this, however, the undulations peculiar to the \" height of land\" are in\nsome places still perceptible. Advancing southwards towards Lake Superior, the landscape becomes thickly interspersed with rock, mountain,\nand lake, till in descending the Michipicoton river, primary rock and a\nbarren sandy soil are met with. 76\nIt is not my wish here to introduce any question relative to an isothermal\nline; but the presumption is, that, were the country explored this season,\nunder cultivation, a condition only precluded by its vast extent, and absence\nof communication, its climate would unless in certain localities, from local\ncauses, differ little from the lower cultivated portions of the Province of\nQuebec, an evidence of which exists in the crops raised undvT the present\nunfavourable circumstances at the Hudson's Bay CompanyIs Posts, north\nof the great Watershed. At Moose Factory the extremes of temperature\nare\u201440<? in winter and-}-89\u00b0 in summer, the average during the coldest\nmonth being so far as I could learn, about+llQ, or a little colder than at\nAbbitibbie, where I procured my figures from the register kept for the\nSmithsonian Institution. The climate of the country is very healthy, and\neven in the heat of summer, the air highly invigorating, but early frosts\nfrequently prevent grain from ripening properly, especially at Moose\nFactory, where the soil is rich alluvial, and the crops over luxuriant for an\nearly harvest. At New Brunswick House, however, situated about 49? 8' N.\nlatitude, I procured a very fair specimen of ripe barley.\nOn Moose Island, in Lat. 51\u00b0 14' 43\" N., the magnetic variation is 13c W.\nand I observed from the Hudson's Bay Company's chart of 1821, that following the meridian of 80v W. Long, at Lat. 52^ 10' N. it is 7\u00b0 W. at 52\u00b0\n40' N. it is 8\u00b0 W., while at Lat. 54p 18\" N. and Long. 80\u00b0 30' W. it is 10\u00b0 W.\nI had no means at my command this season, of ascertaining whether observations taken this year would correspond with those of fifty years ago. In\nthe soundings, so far as I was able to examine during a short trip of three\ndays in James Bay, there seems in general little difference between those\ntaken then and in 1821; that little however indicates a sliting up, but the\nbottom is free from rocks, except a few drift boulders, and the anchorage\n\u2022 excellent.\nAlong our route of exploration we met with some very beautiful and\ninteresting scenery, especially on the Abbitibbie river, of which I made\nsome pencil sketches. On reaching Moose Factory, however, I found from\nMr. J. L. Cotter, Accountant, Southern Department that, during his summer\ntravels in Hudson Bay, he had, as an amateur, photographed many of the\nprincipal scenes we had passed; at the same time presenting me with\nwhat copies he had, including a complete view of Moose Island and\nFactory.\nIn my contact with the Indians, I have been far more successful than I\nanticipated in securing their good opinion, three of them having, as bows-\nman, steersman, and cook, followed us faithfully throughout the entire\nexpedition. The Cree-speaking Indians had become very suspicious of\nthe future in consequence of the transition state of the Company. In\nanswer to many inquiries, which I had neither power nor authority to\nanswer, I constantly assured them that the object and wish of the Canadian Government was to deal fairly by them; also taking care never to\n4eave a post or encampment, before ascertaining to what extent our presence and conduct had met their approval, 77\nIt would be unjust to close this report without expressing my satisfaction with my assistants. To their exertions and intelligence, the rapidity\nof our movements, and the success of the expedition owes much. From\nthe Hudson's Bay officers, in addition to much information and help, we\nmet with much personal kindness.\nI have in hand a statement of the accounts of the expedition which\nwill be submitted at the earliest opportunity.\nAll of which is respectfully submitted by\nSir, your most obedient servant,\nA, McKENZIE,\nEngineer in charge of Division TV\n^.^I^l-SFODXX: TVo. *.\nExplanations by the Engineer in Chief respecting the commencement of the\nSurvey at Mattawa.\nCanadian Pacific Railway,\nOffice of the Engineer in Chief,\nOttawa, May 6, 1872.\nThe Hon. H. L. Langevin, C. B.,\nMinister of Public Works, &c, &c.\nSir,\u2014Objections have been offered, since my Report on the Pacific\nRailway Exploration was made public, to the point selected for beginning\nthe easterly end of the survey. It is therefore proper that I should submit\na few words of explanation, which if you deem expedient, may be included\nin the appendices to the original report and printed with them\nIn the selection of a point for beginning the survey, three main objects\nhad to be kept in view :\u2014\n1st. A connection with the Railways of the Province of Ontario.\n2nd. A connection with the Railways of the Province of Quebec.\n3rd. The discovery of a practicable line for a Railway through the\nwilderness country extending northerly and westerly by Lake Superior toe\nManitoba. SM\n78\nThe Government considered that a point between the G-eorgian  Bay\nand the river Ottawa in the latitude of Lake Nipissing, would generally\nmeet the first two objects, viz.:\u2014the connection with the existing Railway\n'System of the country.\nThe third object appeared, at the time the survey began, the one of\nchief importance, as grave doubts were entertained by many as to the\npossibility of piercing the long extent of rugged country, believed to exist,\nwith a practicable line for the Railway.\nThe G-overnment was extremely anxious that a practicable line should\nbe discovered, withjas little delay as possible, and in order the more effectually to accomplish this object, the Engineer appointed to conduct the\nsurveys was left untrammelled as to the course to be pursued.\nThe G-overnment simply decided that the survey should begin in the\nlatitude of Lake Nipissing somewhere between the 'xeorgian Bay and the\nriver Ottawa; the duty and responsibility of finding a practicable line\nthence westerly devolved upon me.\nThe distance between the G-eorgian Bay and the river Ottawa, in the\nlatitude referred to, is in round figures about 100 miles.    Lake Nipissing\n<08i situated about midway  and with its different bays, practically occupies\n' about 50 miles; or about half the whole distance\nIt was clear that a line for the Pacific Railway, to connect with the\nRailways of Canada to the south, must pass either to the east or to the\nwest of Lake Nipissing.\nEveijy known source of information respecting the country lying between Lake Nipissing and the north era, bend of Lake Superior was fully\nand carefully consulted by me and all accounts agreed as to the exceeding\nroughness and impracticability of the country for Railway construction on\na line drawn from any point between the G-eorgian Bay and the west end\nof Lake Nipissing.\nThe country on aline drawn up the valley of the Ottawa from a point\neast of Lake Nipissing, seemed on the other hand much more promising.\nI satisfied myself that to attempt the discovery of a favorable line on a\nmoderately direct course from the westerly end of Lake Nipissing to the\nnorth side of Lake Superior could only be made at a great expenditure of\ntime and money, and without much hope of success.\nMy duty and object was not to court failure but to aim at success by\nthe most direct course, I therefore decided to look for a satisfactory solution to the problem of practicability, by beginning the survey at a point\neast of Lake Nipissing.\nThe importance of bringing the Pacific Railway as near as practicable fcfe\nto the system of Railways converging at Toronto, without going too much\nout of the direct course to the seaboard is fully recognised.    In relation to\nthis point,   I wish to draw attention   to  certain facts which will probably set some misapprehensions at rest.\nLake Nipissing is situated directly north of Toronto. The Northern\nRailway, the Nipissing Railway, the Whitby, Bowmanville, Port Hope and\nCobourg Railways with their extensions, as now projected, lead to a point\nin the Muskoka District named Bracebridge. Bracebridge is due South of\nand actually nearer the East end of Lake Nipissing than the West end.\nIt seems clear therefore that if a point to the East of Lake Nipissing\nbe found not more distant from Fort G-arry than a point on the West side\nof this Lake, the most direct connection between Fort G-arry and the\nRailways of Ontario would be by the East side of Lake Nipissing.\nI am perfectly satisfied from all the information acquired respecting\nthe geographical position of the different points referred to and the physical features of the intervening country that the probability of finding a\nmore favorable and shorter line, by the West side than by the East side\nof Lake Nipissing is very small.\nBe this as it may, I trust the  explanations  given  with regard to the\ncommencement of the survey are satisfactory.    Of course in beginning'\ninstrumental examinations, it was \u2022 necessary to fix on some definite point.\nI selected Mattawa as this point for similar reasons to those which governed\nme in making the survey East instead of West of Lake Nipissing.\nI do not, however, wish it to be understood that I consider it impracticable to build the Railway nearer the East end of Lake Nipissing than\nMattawa and thence to such point south of it as the (rovernment may\nselect.\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servt,\nSANFDORD FLEMING-, Engineer-in-chief. m\nm\n80\nOO^TEIsTTS.\n\u2022.:*?\u2022\u25a0\u25a0\nlip\nPi\nm\n!#*\n[IP1\n11\nIt\nI'\n.\u25a0:,','\u25a0\nJJjff'V\nI\nm\nm\nI\nm\nPAGE.\nG-eneral Report     2\nAPPENIICES.\nNo. 1.\u2014Table of distances   17\nNo. 2.\u2014Report on Survey between   New   Westminster   and   G-reat\nShuswap Lake     20\nNo 3.\u2014      \"     Exploration from G-reat Shuswap Lake to Howse Pass.. 27\nNo. 4.\u2014      \"      Exploration from Kamloops  and Cariboo  to Yellow\nHead Pass \\..  39\nNo. 5.\u2014      \"      Examination between the Rocky Mountains and Fort\nGarry  50\nNo. 6.\u2014      \"      Survey between Fort G-arry and and Lake Nipissing... 58\nNo. 7.\u2014      \"     The Expedition to James'Bay   73\nNo. 8.\u2014Explanations respecting the commencement of the survey near\nLake Nipissing  77\nMap of part of Canada between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans show*\ning the projected Railway route.\nDiagram, comparative Profiles of the Canadian Pacific Railway and\nthe Union Pacific Railway, U.

HENLEY.\ni HSS> PREFACE.\nUNDER the idea that there are a large number of people\nliving far from the Pacific Coast whose, minds have been\nfired by accounts from the Klondike goldfields, and\nwhose opportunities for obtaining reliable information on this\nsubject are at best poor, I have prepared from my own experience, and from the most authentic sources, some matter which\nI hope may prove useful to them.\nUnder the heading of the j 'Tourist Route to Alaska,'' will\nbe found ajbrief description of the trip from Victoria, to the\npoint of disembarkation, which for the most part is one of\npleasure.\nTMen follows a description in some detail of the overland\njourney to the lakes, and along the lakes and streams connecting them, together with the relative distances between\npoints, down to, and along the swift current of the Yukon to\nDawson.\nThe list comprising the articles of an outfit is intended to\ngive, in a general way, the requirements of a region, frozen\nthe greater part of the year, and difficult and expensive to\nreach.\nThe notes on alluvial prospecting, and those on searching\nfor metalliferous ores are necessarily brief, and can only be of\nuse to the inexperienced prospector who, it is hoped, may\nfind something in them to inform or to guide him in his search\nfor the precious metals, f^pffej\nThe statement of the climatic conditions of the Yukon basin\nis taken from the meteorological reports furnished by the\n.United States and Canadian authorities. I have given the substance of a lecture delivered by Mr.\nWm. Ogilvie, Boundary Commissioner, believing it to be the\nmost important recital of the history and resources of the\nYukon country that has been made.\nThat portion of the diary, appended, of the late Archbishop\nSeghers, whom I had the honour of knowing in the years gone\nby, will be read, no doubt, by many with a very great interest.\nI must not omit acknowledging my indebtedness to my constant young friend, Mr. S. H. F. Rowlinson. I have also to\nthank the local press, and the proprietor of the San Francisco\nMining Journal.\nVictoria, B.C., December 31, 1897.\nXJ THE TRIP\n-TO THE-\nLand of the Midnight Sun.\n-THE-\nALASKA m TOURIST.\nPART I.\nNever before have the wandering steps of the adventurous\nminer carried him into stranger or wilder lands than lie before\nhim on his journey to the far-famed Klondike. Nevertheless,\nhe goes off, undaunted, and the hardships and dangers which\naccompany his varied life, vanish before the fascinating dream\nof acquiring a share of the golden sands of the north.\nHe constantly, during his ups and downs, is buoyed up\nwith the pleasing hope of some day returning to home and\nfriends, having, as the phrase goes, \"made his pile.,,\nTHE   START.\nStarting from Victoria, the ship follows a wavering northern\ncourse, through the grandest scenery, affording a fine view of\nevergreen islands, the forests, and icy mountains of the Coast.\nVictoria is a handsome town, a section of old England set\ndown nearly unchanged in the west. It is situated on the\nsouth east end of Vancouver Island, which is 289 miles long,\nthe largest of the archipelago that stretches northward along\nthe margin of the continent for nearly a thousand miles.\nh 10\nTourists usually stop here for a few days, and most of them\ngo to the famous stores of the Hudson's Bay Company, to purchase furs or some wild Indian trinket. In the warehouses\nmay be seen the clothing of bears, panthers, foxes and musk-\nrats, and many others of \"our poor earth-born companions\nand fellow mortals.\"\nleaving Victoria we move into a narrow sea, so narrow\nthat we seem to be tracing a\nMAJESTIC RIVER\nwith lake-like expansions, the tide-currents, the drift wood\nbrought down by avalanches, the inflowing torrents, and the\nluxuriant foliage of the shores making the likeness complete.\nThen rounding some cape, the eye perchance is called away\ninto a far receding vista, head lands on each side in charming\narray.\nFive hundred and fifty miles of this scenery and we reach\nthe boundary line, \"Forty-four forty,\" at the head of Queen\nCharlotte Islands. We are now in Alaska. This is the name\nof all that portion of the northwest extremity of this continent, which, until '67 was known as Russian America.\nOne hundred and fifty miles further on and the ship\narrives at\nFORT  WRANGEI,,\non Wrangel Island, near the mouth of the Stickine River.\nIt is a quiet, dreamy old place, of a few hundreds of whites,\nand Indians living in their own strange way, midst the most\ndelightful scenery imaginable. Baron Wrangel established a\ntrading post here about a century ago, and the fort, a massive\nstockade, was built by the United States. Indians mostly of\nthe Stickine tribe occupy the two long draggled ends of the\ntown along the shore, the whites numbering about 50, the\nmiddle portion.\nCURIOS OF WRANGEIv.\nOn the arrival of the steamer, most of the passengers go\nashore to see the curious totem-poles in front of the massive\ntimber houses of the Indians, and to buy curiosities, such as\ncarved spoons, shaman rattles, miniature canoes, silver bracelets hammered from dollars and tastefully engraved by Indian\nworkmen; paddles, baskets, mats, etc. The traders in these\ncurious wares are mostly women, who sit in front of the stores,\nthe girls, brilliantly arrayed in ribbons and calico, the older\nones sitting in their blankets, seemingly careless whether they\nsell anything or not. These Indians are proud and intelligent,\nand maintain an air of self-respect which tattered blankets and\nblackened faces cannot wholly subdue. 11\nTHE FOOD  OF THE INDIANS.\nWhat the mustang is to the Mexican vaquero the canoe is\nto the Indian of the Coast. In summer they may be seen in\nmerry bands skimming over the glassy and sheltered waters,\nthe long beak-like prow, and stern of their canoes blithely\ndecorated * with purple epilobium, on their way to fish or\ngather berries, and perhaps no where else can be seen so\nmany berries, the woods and the meadows, and open spaces\nalong the shore are full of them, hundreds of tons might\neasily be gathered, and yet sufficient for every one in the\nterritory remain. The Indians press them into cakes and dry\nthem for winter use, to be eaten as bread with their salmon.\nWOODS.\nGoing into the woods almost anywhere, you have first to\nforce a way through an outer tangle of Robus, huckleberry,\ndogwood, and elder bushes, and a strange woody plant several\nfeet high} with limber, rope-like stems beset with thorns, and\na head of broad leaves like the crown of a palm. This is the\ndevil's club {Echino panax horrida) it is used by the Indians\nfor beating witches. Back in the shady depths of the woods\nwhere the walking is free, you will be charmed with the\nbeauty and grandeur of the trees, as well as the solemn stillness of the forest. Wander where you may, wilderness ever\nfresh and ever beautiful, meets you in endless variety.\nTHE  WEATHER  ON THE  COAST.\nThe climate of that portion of the Coast that is washed by\nthe Japan current, is remarkably mild and free from extremes\nof heat and cold. An Alaskan midsummer day is a day without night. At Sitka and Wrangel the sun sinks only a few\ndegrees below the horizon, so that the rosy colors of the\nevening blend with those of the morning, leaving no gap of\ndarkness between. In late autumn and winter roaring storms\ncome down and fill the days and nights with steady rains and\nwinds.\nALL-CANADIAN ROUTE.\nThe prospector who proposes taking this route will now\nhave to disembark from the ocean steamef and transship his\nsupplies to a river steamer, which will take him up the\nStickine River, the mouth of which, at Rothsay Point, is\n12 miles from Wrangel. The river has a swift current and is\nusually open for navigation between the end of April and\nmiddle of May. Steamers of a light draft can ascend to\nGlenora, 140 miles from Rothsay Point, and canoes to Telegraph Creek, 12 miles further on, At Glenora, the banks are low and slope gently to the water.\nIce beins to run about the end of November, and a little later\nthe river freezes over. In winter months miners haul their\nsupplies, loaded on sleds, on the ice, and dogs and other\nhardy animals are pressed into service to aid in this toilsome\nwork.\nFrom Glenora to Lake Teslin, the commencement of the\ninland fresh waterway, the distance is said to be 153 miles,\nover a comparatively level country, dotted by marshes,\nswamps, ponds and lakes,\nTHE FIRST  OBSTACLE\nmet with on the journey is the Taltal River, which is 21 miles\nfrom Glenora. This river is swift, and at this point runs\nbetween high gravel banks.\nTHE SECOND  OBSTACLE\nwe meet is also a river, the Nialino, and this, like the first,\nis swift but shallow, ahd somewhat wider than the Taltal. In\nthis district the foothills are timbered with spruce, hemlock\nand pine. Further on stretches of marsh are met, which\nwould, unless corduroyed, necessitate a considerable divergence to the side hills. Now comes Lake Teslin, about 100\nmiles long, at which boats are built, and from which on the\nwater journey presents no great difficulties.\nIf improvements were made on this trail packing could be\ndone from May to the middle or end of October, at which time\nthe lakes and rivers commence to freeze. Sawmills and boatbuilding would then enliven the scene around Lake Teslin.\nTHE HOOTALINQUA\nor Tes-lin-loo, as the Indians call this river, leaves Lake\nTeslin and follows a northwesterly direction to its confluence\nwith the Lewes River, 28 miles below Lake Le Barge. In its\ncourse of about 120 miles, it receives numerous tributaries, and\nwherever prospecting has been done gold has been found.\nFrom Seymour Creek, entering about midway of its course,\ngood reports have come, but owing to the difficulty in the\npast of getting in sufficient supplies, miners were obliged to\nabandon their prospects.\nWhen the spring is well advanced, the country at intervals\nprovides good grazing for pack animals, but cannot be depended on to supply grass at the close of the summer season.\nWe now return to the\nSTICKINE RIVER.\nThe scenic glories of the river country cannot fail to excite\nwonder and admiration, and the thousands of tourists who 13\nwill come to the Coast to see Alaska, and the extraordinary\nsights accompanying the rush to the gold fields will be well\nrepaid for their trouble.\nThe Stickine River follows a westerly course through\ngrassy plains, then curving southward and receiving numerous\ntributaries from the north, it enters the coast range and\nsweeps across it to the sea, through a valley that is from i to 3\nmiles broad, and marvelously beautiful from end to end.\nThe canon of the river is a gallery of sublime pictures, an\nunbroken series of high mountains, glaciers, waterfalls, cascades, groves and grassy meadows, and above them all many\npeaks and spires tower grandly into the sky.\nLeaving Wrangel and continuing the journey northward,\nthe ship passes through the picturesque Wrangel Narrows into\nSouchoi Channel and Frederick Sound. Near Cape Fanshaw\nyou are opposite a group of glaciers, the largest of which is the\nPatterson glacier. At Sum Dum or Halkam Inlet, another\nfleet of icebergs come in sight. The scenery in this inlet is of\nthe wildest description. About 40 miles up the Coast more icebergs appear; this is the entrance to Taku Inlet. It is 18\nmiles long, and in this distance you may count 45 glaciers, a\nsight worth coming round the world to see. The beautiful\nTaku glacier might well be mentioned here, but by and bye\nwe will see the grandest of them all.\nTAKU   ROUTE.\nThis route starts at the head of Taku Inlet, and involves\nconsiderable hardships. Small boats take travellers to the\nhead of the inlet. Then the inland journey commences. The\ntrail crosses a high mountain, and then following the canon of\nthe Taku River for some distance, turns a little to the east\nand follows the side hills of an opening in the Coast range of\nmountains to the Inklin river, a distance of about 80 miles.\nHere rafts or boats are built, and the long water journey commences. This route avoids the Grand Canyon and the White\nHorse Rapids, but the avoidance of these wild waters is\nscarcely sufficient compensation when weighed With the uphill and down-hill toil of a long and rough trail.\nA little down the inlet is Juneau, hemmed in in front by the\nwater, and a towering mountain rising like a wall at the back.\nJust across on Douglas Island is the great\nTREAD WELL  QUARTZ MINE.\nDense columns of smoke are seen issuing from the chlori-\nnation works which\" are here, burning that part of the ore\nwhich the batteries have not been able to separate from the 14\ngold. Its poisonous vapors that the humid atmosphere has\ncrowded down the mountain sides have bleached the timber\nalmost white. SPl\nPassing between Douglas and Admiralty Islands the\nsteamer turns to the south into Icy Strait, and moves across to\nGLACIER BAY.\nThe largest of the seven glaciers that discharge into Glacier\nBay is the Muir. The front is about three miles wide, but the\ncentral berg-discharging portion, which extends across the\ninlet; like a huge blue barrier, is only about half as wide.\nThe height of the ice-wall above the water is about 300 feet,\nand 720 feet of the wall is below the surface, while still a third\nunmeasured portion is buried beneath the material that is\nbeing constantly deposited at the foot of it. Therefore, were\nthe water and rocky detritus removed, there would be presented a sheer precipice of ice a mile and a half wide and more\nthan 1,000 feet in height. The bergs given off fall with tremendous noise like distant thunder. The average rate is\nabout one in six minutes. The largest and most beautiful of\nthe bergs, instead of falling from the exposed wall, rise from\nthe submerged portion with grand commotion, heaving aloft\ntons of water, while they plunge and heave before they sail\naway as crystal islands, free at last, and happy, one might\nthink, after being held in an icy grasp for centuries. This\ngrand glacier, draining an area of perhaps 1,000 square miles,\nand reaching back fifty miles into mysterious solitudes, is two\nhundred times as large as the Mer de Glace of the Alps. The\nrate of the motion in the central cascading portion is from\nseven to ten feet a day. Think of Niagara Falls frozen stiff\nand you have a slight idea of the terminus of Muir Glacier ;\npicture a background of Snow-capped mountains 15,000 feet\nhigh, and then imagine, if you can, the effect* of the sunshine\npouring in iris colors on the crystal ice.\njj||j|| A SILENT  CITY.\nAn unknown city is said to have been seen by Professor\nDavis, in mirage over Muir glacier. The buildings seemed to\nhim of massive dimensions, extending in solid and unbroken\nblocks as far as the eye could reach. The entire limits of the\ncity were confined within a halo of light, dense yet transparent,\npouring its soft glow upon roof and wall in glorious transformation. To the right and left a range of mountains, covered with the garb of winter, formed the background.    The 15 W\ntop of a high monument in the center of a broad street seemed\nto pierce its ghostly robes. At one end of the street a large\nbuilding with a dome, while near the other end a piazza having beneath it an excavation running out to the sea appeared.\nAt the other end of the excavation the walls of a building\nstood apparently uninjured, while the roof had disappeared\nand smoke seemed to issue from the interior. From beyond\nthe burning building a driveway, in the form of a crescent,\nseemed to encircle a portion of the city. Yet within the whole\nof its length and breadth not one soul could be seen. AH was\nsilent as a grave. When suddenly the vision began to move\naway. Its glories and grandeur lured with a fascination which\nhe could not resist. But as he walked forward it seemed to\nrecede with every pace, and before he could get within the\nsilent portals it was wafted into space and lost to view.\nThe city is said to resemble Bristol, England, but beyond\nthat it remains unidentified.\nThe summers in Alaska are delightful\u2014never oppressively\nwarm ; the long nightless days never lose their spell, and in\nretrospect the wonders of the Northland appear the greater.\nLeaving Glacier Bay the steamer proceeds northward into\nLynn Canal, the most beautiful of all the mountain-walled\nchannels you have yet seen. The Auk and Eagle glaciers\nappear in one view on the right as you enter ; but it is on the\nwest side, near the head of the canal, that the most striking\nfeature of the landscape is seen\u2014the wonderfully picturesque\nDavidson glacier. Shortly after passing this glacier the\nnorthernmost point of the trip is reached at Taiya, the head of\nChilcoot Inlet\u2014the east Arm of Lynn Canal\u2014a little above\n590, and distant from Victoria 1,000 miles.\nThis is the Alaska of the tourist, famous for its glaciers, its\nbeautiful inlets, and its picturesque Indians and their totem\npoles. But beyond the big white range is another and a\ntotally different country, the valley of the Yukon. Just across\nthe coast range from Taiya is a chain of lakes surrounded by\nsnowy mountains and coneected by a narrow stream, which,\nafter receiving numerous tributaries, swells into a great river\nand pours its huge flood into Behring Sea. On the lower half\nof its course the river receives the waters of the Porcupine,\nTanana, Kokukuk and numerous small streams, until the\nmountain brook has, in the 2,400 miles of its course, become\none of the greatest rivers on the earth. Leaving the tourist at\nthe head of Lynn Canal the prospector's holiday ends, and he\nprepares for the more serious task of crossing the mountains. 535P\n16\nAt the head of the canal there are two trails over the mountains, which unite at the lakes beyond.\nCHILCOOT PASS TRAIL.\nLanding at Taiya, or Dyea, as the miners call it, the plan\nis to follow the usual route Of miners bound for Dawson City\n\u2014to cross the Chilcoot Pass and descend to the lakes on the\nother side, dragging the outfit on hand-sleds across these lakes\nto a point where there are trees to build a boat in which to\ncontinue the journey. Near the landing place there is a\nvillage of Thlinket Indians, who assist travellers in packing\ntheir supplies at so much per pound. In August the price\nwas eight cents to the summit and twenty-five cents to the\nlakes.\nThe route lies up the valley of the Dyea River, and at certain\nstages of the water, boats can ascend to within a mile of the\ncanon, a distance of five miles, and canoes can go one mile\nfurther. Here packing commences, and a little further on the\nsled is loaded, and the mountain climb commences up a steep\nincline to Sheep Camp, a distance of eleven or twelve miles\nfrom the shore. The elevation of this point is about 800 feet.\nLooking up a large gorge, flanked by precipitous snow-covered\nmountains, you can see at the summit a little notch known as\nthe Chilcoot Pass, the gate to the Yukon treasures. The seriousness of the task is not apparent. In April the snow had\ndisappeared at sea level, but a short distance up the cafion the\nground was covered with it. A few hours' hard climbing\nbrings us to the scales, where supplies are weighed, near the\nlast and hardest part of the ascent.    This point is about five\nI miles from Sheep Camp.    A toilsome and terrible journey of\nabout a mile up an incline rising at an angle of about forty-\nfive degrees, and we reach the summit. From this lofty and\n, narrow crest of snow and ice we see below the tortuous zigzag\ntrail and ahead the valley of the Yukon stretching away in\nbillows of spotless white.\nThe elevation of the pass is 3,378 feet. The upper limit of\ntimber is reached near the foot of the dreaded pass on the\nsouth side, at an elevation of 2,300 feet, and on the north side\n1,000 feet below the summit.\nPreparations are now made for the descent\u2014the sled is\nloaded, and everything made secure for the wild ride down the\nicy slope. The route is through a gorge and the sled shoots\nalong like an arrow with the motion of a boat in a choppy\nsea.    All goes well while it remains on an even keel, but if it 17\nshould strike a rock or other obstacle in its flight the consequences, in all likelihood, would be serious.\nLeaving the gorge the sled runs on to a sort of bench or\nflat, and four miles down the ravine brings us to a clump of\ndwarfed spruce trees, the upper limit of timber. A few miles\nfurther on and we reach Lake Linderman. The work of\ngetting supplies over the mountain when the snow is soft\nentails labor of the most slavish kind. If the lake is clear of\nice the usual course is to build a raft and float down to the\nend, and then pack the supplies over the ridge to the head of\nLake Bennet.\nLake Linderman is five miles long and half a mile wide,\nand the first of the chain of six lakes of the Upper Yukon.\nIt is shut in by glacier-worn granite hills, and here and there\nalong its shores are a few small pine and spruce trees. All of\nthese lakes remain frozen until May. The trail comes out at\nthe east side of the lake. The timber is not sufficiently long\nfor boats, and instead of taking to the stream, a crooked and\nrocky one, and dangerous for boats, which connects Linderman with Lake Bennet, the trail follows a sandy ridge three-\nquarters of a mile long to the head of Lake Bennet, where the\ntrails unite.\nHere the following\nINSCRIPTION\nwas nailed to a tree over eleven years ago :\n\"Archbishop of Victoria, V.I., accompanied by Fathers\nTosi and Robant, camped here and offered the holy sacrifice,\nJuly 30, 1886.\"\nThe above was written by the late Archbishop Seghers\nscarcely four months before the tragedy (see diary) of Melozi-\nkakat, on the lonely banks of the Yukon.\nWe will now return to the coast, and as a very large proportion of the travel was over the White Pass, it will here be described in detail.\nSKAGWAY.\nThe town is situated about two miles south of the head of\nChilcoot Inlet, and about four miles from Dyea, from which\nit is separated by a rocky point. When the reports came out\nin June of the great discoveries of gold, Skagway was a desolate looking place, without accommodation of any kind for\nthe thousands that were soon to land on its long sandy\nbeach. Now, twenty-six hotels and saloons are open day and\nnight, and all the concomitants of a fast town are present.\nThe population has grown to about 3,000, and frame build- 18\nings occupy the place where tents were a few months ago.\nThe cost of living has dropped from the boom prices of early\nspring to a rate very little in excess of those in the larger\n.towns to the south. The difficulties, too, of landing freight\nhave largely disappeared. Three fine wharves running out to\ndeep water have been built, and no longer will be seen the\npull-dog pull-devil struggle of horses, dogs and men on the\nbeach.\nWHITE PASS TRAIL.\nStarting from the bay, about half a mile in width, at the\nmouth of the Skagway River, the trail follows the southerly\nbank for about a mile, then crosses over the bridge and continues on for about three miles to the foot of the hill, at which\nplace there was a little colony of campers who christened the\nplace Eden. There was one lady, a Mrs. Etelstone, from\nKentucky, in the camp in August. Up to this point the trail\nis over level bottom land and admits of the use of wagons ;\nbut here the mountains close in, and the trail rises up the side\nfor about three miles till it reaches an elevation of about 1,000\nfeet, when it descends to a large tributary of the Skagway\ncalled Porcupine Creek, which it crosses over a bridge,\nand after winding along a hillside known as the Porcupine\nHill, descends to the bank of the river, which it follows for\nabout 400 yards to the next bridge, a distance of about four\nmiles from Porcupine Creek. Just below this crossing the\nriver is contracted to a width of about eight feetv The trail\nnow follows the south bank of the river for about two miles,\nwhen it again crosses, and, rising over a spur of the mountains, about 150\" feet above the river, descends to the fourth\ncrossing, a distance of about half a mile from the third crossing. From this point there are two trails, one known as the\n\"cut-off\" and the other as the \"turtle-back.\" The cut-off\nfollows along the river and is used by packers, while the main\ntrail follows down stream for a little way and then crosses the\nTurtle-back Mountain at an elevation of about 1,300 feet above\nthe level of the river. This part of the trail over the \u25a0' turtle-\nback, \" which is about two miles, is conceded to be worse for\nhorses than any other. At the river the trails re-join, and\nfollowing the bank for about half a mile cross the river for the\nfifth and last time at the ford which brings us to the foot of\nthe summit. Up to this point there is a good deal of timber,\nbut from the ford to the summit, a distance of two miles, and\nfrom the summit to the first meadow, three miles further on,\nthere is no timber.\njr==^=\t 19\nTHE PASS\nis perhaps a mile wide, and its height is hardly more than\n1,000 feet above the ford. The view is grand on a clear day.\nLooking backward the dark valley of the Skagway can be\ntraced winding its way through the white domes looming in\nthe azure of the sky, while in front, on either side, stretches\nan elastic carpet of golden mosses dotted by miniature lakes\nand ponds, and flanked by an unbroken series of peaks in\nspotless white, down which avalanches from the snow-laden\nheights boom and reverberate. Here storm-winds gather in\nthe early spring, choking the air with snow and sweep over\nthe lakes beyond. From the summit to the first meadow the\ndescent is very gradual. The First Meadow, as it is called, is a\nlong strip of peat marsh, rather than meadow land. Here a\nnumber of horses, too weak from want of food\u2014the miners,\ntrusting to the meadows, packed no hay over the summit\u2014\nwere abandoned during the summer. It is four miles from the\nfirst meadow to the second which is similar to the first, but\nless in area, and about eight miles to the Rocky Ford which\ncrosses Shallow Lake, a strip of water several miles in length.\nThe trail now skirts the lake for over a half a mile and continues through a better timbered country over ridges and\nmarshy places. After passing through about six miles of this\nkind of country the trail comes out at the lower end of Lake\nLinderman, and turning to the right follows along the ridge\nabove the rapids to the head of Lake Bennett, the junction of\nthe Dyea and White Pass trails.\nThe heavy demands made upon the trail by the thousands\nof men and horses churned every marshy spot into a mud hole.\nArriving at the head of Bennett Lake before June there are\ntwo courses open to the traveller, either to proceed over the\nice with his sleigh or to go into camp and build a boat. If he\nshould decide to push on at once he may, if fortune favours\nhim with a good breeze, make good time by putting on the\nfront of the sled a V-shaped mast and rigging up a sail with a\ntent-fly or blanket. If, on the other hand, he determines to\nwait for open water, he can buy boards at the mill, 200 yards\naway, or fell trees, construct a % saw-pit,\" a scaffolding about\neight feet high, and whip-saw the timber into suitable lengths\nfor his boat. The whipsaw is an instrument about eight feet\nlong with a handle at either end.\nDIMENSIONS OF BOATS.\nWhen you make or buy a boat have it at least twenty-two\nfeet long on the bottom, with a prow projecting two feet.\nHave the widest part of the boat about one-third of the dis- 20\ntance aft from the bow. From there have it taper somewhat\nto the stern. Have the stern with quite a rake, otherwise it\nwill be swamped in the rapids, and the bottom should be four\nor five inches higher at the stern than amidships.\nThe cost of boats varies very considerably at the lakes. In\nlast August the price for a good boat was two hundred\ndollars. Timber for boat building is sawed into straight\nboards a suitable length, and ten inches wide and three-\nfourths of an inch thick.\nLake Bennett is 25.8 miles long, and the upper end is about\nhalf a mile wide, and lies between beetling granite ranges\nwhich rise from the water to heights of 3,000 and 4,000 feet.\nAbout midway of its length another arm, called Wheaton\nRiver, comes in from the west. This arm is wider than the\nother and terminates in rugged and bare mountains. The\nregion is in every sense an Alpine one. The lower part of the\nlake is over a mile wide, with deep muddy water. Here a\nbroad valley opens to the north, and the beach is low and flat.\nTo the east. *are high hills, around which the water turns in\nin a channel called Caribou crossing, about 300 feet wide,\nand which soon expands into another lake.\nCaribou Crossing, so called because great bands of caribou\ncross here. These splendid animals roam over the great unexplored region extending to the head waters of the Dease\nand Liard Rivers, and hundreds of miles beyond to the\nMackenzie River, which flows from the Great Slave Lake in\nthe Northwest, and pursuing a northerly course empties into\nthe Arctic Ocean. A short stretch of river joins Bennett with\nNares.\nLake Nares is the shortest of the system; it is 2.7 miles\nlong, and its greatest width is about a mile. On the east\nside the mountains rise abruptly from the shore. It is joined\nwith Bove Lake by a channel of about 600 yards long. Low\nalluvial land covered with willows extends along the channel\nto the west end of Bove Lake.\nBove or Tagish Lake is about a mile wide for the first two\nmiles of its length, when it is joined by the Bras des Vents\n(Windy Arm). Here the lake expands, but soon narrows\nagain to about half a mile. Ten miles from its head the Taku\nArm enters from the south. The region of the lakes is most\npicturesque, abounding in striking points of view, and in landscapes pleasing in variety, and grand and impressive in their\nrugged forms. The elevation of this remarkable system of'\nlakes above the sea, by aneroid barometer, is 2,088 to 2,150\nfeet. 21\nTaku Arm, twenty miles long, is narrowed at the entrance\nto a width of about a mile, and is bordered on the west side by\na uniform wall-like range of limestone mountains sloping to\nthe water. The lower end of Tagish Lake occupies a valley\nwhich runs through to Bennet Lake. The west side is very\nflat and shallow, and is usually followed as it affords some\nshelter from the strong winds which come up from the south.\nThe Pow-Wow, a short tranquil reach of river, five miles in\nlength and about 170 yards wide, connects Tagish with Marsh\nLake. This stream was open in mid-channel in the early\npart of May. The weather had been quite warm for several\ndays, and the snow had benun to melt in the valley of the\nriver. About four miles down on the west bank there is a nice\ncamping ground, and directly opposite are Indian log houses,\nthe yearly rendezvous of bands of natives.\nThe Thinklet Indians from Chilcat, Taiya, and the Tenne-\nhes, from as far away as the mouth of the Pelly River, meet on\nthis neutral ground to trade, and indulge in their great annual\ndrunk with the accompanying feasts and dances. In this\nvicinity there is good timber for boat building. On May 13\nthe air was alive with geese on their northward migration,\nand a day or two later came the wavies (anser hypirboreus) ;\nsmall game, such as ducks, rabbits and grouse are plentiful.\nMarsh Lake is nearly twenty miles long and about two\nmiles wide. It lies in a continuation of the same wide valley\noccupied by the lower end of Tagish Lake. On the east side\nthe banks are high and gravelly and lolty mountains in the\ndistance bound the view. On the left are low grassy meadows beyond which broken hills are seen. At the lower end\nMcClintock river enters from the east, bringinn down great\nquantities of drift wood, which is banked high near its mouth.\nBetween Lake Marsh and Lake LeBarge, which is the last\nand longest of the chain of lakes, there are fifty-five miles of\nriver, but in this distance are the two greatest obstacles to\nnavigation in the whole Yukon system\u2014Miles Canon and\nWhite Horse Rapids. Spring had advanced with such astonishing rapidity that the snow had almost disappeared on May\n14, and the weather was superb.\nLewis River, where it leaves Marsh Lake has received the\nname of Lynx River. It is about two hundred yards wide\nand averages this distance as far as the canon. Twenty-five\nmiles from Lake Marsh we come to a bend, and now see\nahead a brown rocky ridge divided by a slit less than 50 feet\nwide, and at the same time hear the roar of the rapids in their\nwild rush through the canon.\nTo make the run successfully is easily practicable, but it is\nJ 22\nimperative to keep in the centre of the channel and not to\nallow the boat to be caught in the eddies.\nThere are two ways of passing the rapids, one by portaging\nover the hill on the east bank, and the other by boldly\nrunning through. To utilize the portage the boats are unloaded and dragged out of the water, and by means of a windlass drawn up the hill slope, about 100 feet high, and then\npulled on rollers for three-quarters of a mile to the river.\nThe Archbishop, whose diary is appended, describes the\nrapids as follows :\n\"Miles Cation, about five-eighths of a mile in length, lies\nbetweeu two steep, almost perpendicular cliffs of basalt about\nioo feet in height, in the shape of columns, through which\nthe whole river, compressed into a space of 50 feet, rushes\nwith tremendous velocity. The water boils up in large waves,\nhaving a depression in the centre so that no floating object\ncan possibly strike against the rocks of the bank. For about\na quarter of a mile the banks are nearly parallel; then they\nwiden out, the current being more slack between two eddies,\nthe water after leaving this wide circular basin rushes over a\nlarge rock into another channel and leaves the Canon roaring\nand foaming, as if to testify to its fury. One boat was unloaded and the supplies packed across the trail along the\nCation. Fuller, an attendant, took the helm, Father Robaut\ntook an oar, the miner we had picked up took another, and as\nI did not want to see my people jeopardise their lives without\nsharing their danger, I took my place in front of the boat, my\nwatch in hand, to measure the velocity of our locomotion.\nMy presence seemed to remove from my followers all dread of\nthe gloomy Cation. We started off at 1 p.m., and in a\nmoment the swift current caught our boat and whirled it\nbetween the breakers on each side of the Cation. It was a\nterrible scene. We were visibly on an incline and rushing\ndown hill with the speed of a locomotive. The roaring of the\nwater, the spray that filled the air all around us, the waves\nthat struck our scow, which rolled and pitched as if on the\nbillows of the sea, made an impression on our minds that will\nnot easily be forgotten. But we had no time for reflection.\nIn a few moments we found ourselves in a slack current and\nbetween two eddies, which we had to avoid most carefully.\nThen another plunge into the rest of the 'Canon. Passing\nover a rock over which the water poured and foamed a liquid\nhill behind us that screened from our view the head of the\nCanon; we were hauled right and left, tossed and shaken,\nshipping the water at intervals and merging from the dark\nplace, having made a mile in three minutes and twenty-five 23\nseconds. A quick motion of the rudder gave a sharp turn to\nour scow and brought her into slack water, whilst we landed\nwhere three of the miners waved their hats to congratulate us\non the success of our achievement.\nOn Wednesday morning, August 25, we left the foot of\nMiles Canon, and reached safely the head of White Horse\nRapids, a distance of about two miles. Here we had to unload our boat again and pack the supplies once more a distance\nof about a mile. Next day we let our boat down the Cafion,\nholding her stern from the shore with a line and pushing her\noff the rocks with poles.. This Canon has not the same dreadful appearance as Miles Canon, but the water is shallow and\nvery boisterous, it rushes over boulders and dashing against\nthem, it recoils and boils backwards, covering itself with a\nwhite crest which some extravagant imagination has compared to the mane of a white horse. At one moment our boat\nwas in imminent danger of perishing. She filled with water,\nsank, and carried away by the current, snatched away the\nlines from the hands that were holding them, when, in the\nnick of time, Fuller caught the lines with a pole, all joining\nin a supreme effort got control of the boat and brought her\nto an eddy. She was promptly bailed out and landed safely\nat the foot of White Horse Rapids.\"\nTAKH-HEENA RIVER,\nFifteen miles from White Horse Rapids, we come to the\nTakh-heena River, which has its source in the Chilkat.mountains to the west, and is joined by the Nat-sun-tur River near\nthe falls, about 40 miles from its mouth, which is 12 miles\nfrom S||K\nLAKE LE BARGE.\nThis lake was frozen May 18, although the river was open.\nIt is 31 miles long and from three to six miles wide. The\nupper end is enclosed by sandstone hills through which there\nare several channels. When the lake is clear of ice, boats\nshould be headed for an island in the centre, and then cross to\nthe right hand and follow close to the bank as a safeguard in\ncase a storm should be encountered. The lake, which has an\nelevation of 2,088 feet,, lies between broken hills, around\nwhich it takes a sharp turn to to the east, with a current of\nperhaps six miles an hour. Near the end of May the weather\nwas warm and\nOPEN WATER\nwas reached on leaving Lake Le Barge on the 20th May.\nFrom here to its mouth the Yukon is unobstructed, save by a\nU f\n24\ncouple of unimportant rapids, and the remainder of the journey with fine weather, may be a delightful excursion.\nx^EWES RIVER.\nThe Lewes River, on leaving the lake, is 600 feet in width,\nThis part of the stream from Lake Le Barge to the Pelly River,\nis called by the miners, Lewes River; it is, as a matter of fact,\npart of the Yukon. The surface of the country is rolling and\nhilly, backed by low mountains, and generally wooded in the\nvalleys, the uplands being bare. Caribou and moose are\noccasionally seen. 31 miles from Lake Le Barge we come\nonce more to the Hootalinqua, and 33 below, the\nBIG  SALMON\nenters, coming from Lake Quiet, 150 miles or more to the south\neast, and beyond which is an unexplored country. This river\nreceived its name from the quantity of salmon in its waters.\nIt is wonderful how this beautiful fish forces its way over bars\nand rapids for nearly 1,800 miles from Behring Sea. 35 miles\nfurther on at the mouth of the Little Salmon the Tinueh\nIndians have a camp. They are a fine looking lot of people,\ndressed in skins and furs.    Long before we reach the\nFIVE FINGER  RAPIDS,\nwhich are 59 miles from Little Salmon, we can see the five\ncolumns of rock in the channel of the river. By keeping to\nthe right no difficulty will be found in running through. Six\nmiles lower down are the\nRINK  RAPIDS.\nThese rapids are formed by a bar of rocks extending some\ndistance out from the west side of the river. On the east side\nthe passage is quite clear. Light draught steamers with\npowerful machinery, could ascend to the head of Teslin Lake,\n300 miles from Five Fingers. The river is here much swifter\nthan above, and we need row only enough to break the\nmonotony of lounging about in the boat as we drift along past\nthe hills which close in at the west side 25 miles from\nPELLY RIVER,\nwhich is about 300 miles long. It flows from Lake Francis,\nin the south east, aud follows a north-westerly course to its\njunction with the McMillan, a large river, coming from a\ngreat unexplored country extending to the rocky mountains,\nand then bends, following a westerly course to its junction\nwith the Lewes River, 53 miles from the Rink Rapids. 25\nFORT SELKIRK.\nNothing now remains of this old fort but a blackened chimney. It is a little distance below the junction of the Lewes\nand Pelly, and here Harper, whose history is so closely connected with the country, has a trading post.\nLeaving Fort Selkirk, islands are numerous, and the valley\npreserves its usual depth of about 800 feet. Cliffs of basaltic\nrocks are passed, and gravel terraces occur occasionally, decreasing in height as we descend. The river now follows a\nW. N. W. bearing, but lower down bends to the E. and\nfollows a north-easterly direction. Wooded banks and steep\nslopes with rocky bluffs above, are the chief features of this\npart of the country.    We now reach the\nWHITE  RIVER,\nwhich is 95 miles from the Pelly, a great stream fed by tributaries coming from as far away as Mt. St. Elias in the west.\nA view up it showed a wide valley filled with countless bars\nand islands, between which the swift stream threads its tortuous\ncourse and enters the Yukon with a force sufficient to drive its\nwhite muddy water half way across and to change the colour\nof the Yukon from a pale green to white, for a distance of over\n100 miles.     Ten miles below the\nSTEWART RIVER\nenters the Yukon from the east. A number of prospectors\nwere at work on its branches near the mouth during the summer. A hundred miles up, it receives the McQuestion, where\nit is 400 feet wide and it is deep enough and sufficiently free\nfrom bars and rocks to be navigated by flat-bottomed steamers\nthat distance. Moose are plentiful and fish abnndant. Along\nthe valley of the river are great quantities of berries, such as\nblack and red currants, gooseberries, raspberries, cranberries,\nand huckleberries. Recent accounts of an official character\nfrom this district declare it to be exceedingly rich.\nAn important feature of the river is the constant recurrence\nalong it of high gravel terraces, most of which are more or\nless auriferous. It is possible that the gold found on the bars\nin the river is concentrated from these.\nTwenty-one miles further on we pass Sixty-Mile Creek.\nTHE VALLEY OF THE YUKON.\nLeaving the Stewart the river maintains a general northerly\ncourse, and in the expanded stretches islands occupy much of\nthe surface.    Beaches line the shore and tracking is possible\nu 26\nfor the remainder of the journey. The current is swift and\nuniform, and at a medium state of the waters runs about 5\nmiles an hour. The width of the river occasionally exceeds a\nmile, but it narrows as we approach our destination. The\nvalley of the Yukon from the Pelly is cut through an elevated\nplateau, on which rest low ranges of partially bare hills, which\nafford some grand views. Bluffs of rocks and bold rampartlike cliffs are of constant occurrence. The width of the valley\nvaries from one to three miles.\nWe are beside the Indian village Klonjec, from which it is\nthought Klondike comes.. It matters little, however, our objective point is here, we have come 66 miles from the Stewart\nRiver, the mighty Yukon continues its uninterrupted course\nto the sea, and we are now at Dawson, the city of gold. 27\nDAWSON CITY.\nThe townsite is regularly laid out and comprises an area\nof 160 acres. A broad avenue separates the town from the\nYukon. The south portion is on the lower side of the Klondike River where it joins the Yukon and the trail to the mines\nleads through it and along the side hill at the back. A few\nhundreds live on this side. The north side, on the opposite\nbank, is a low and rather marshy piece of ground of about 100\nacres and is covered with moss. In cold weather a strong\nwind usually blows up the Yukon, and Dawson, being on the.\nbend of the river, receives the full force of the blast. But\nwhen the temperature is very low a dead calm prevails. The\npopulation was over 5,000 in September and increasing daily;\nhundreds are scattered along the route. Most of the houses\nare constructed of logs, hewn so as to rest flat on each other.\nPoles are placed across the roofs and layers of moss and earth\nof fifteen or twenty inches cover them and serve to keep out\nthe winter's cold. The heavy frost cracks green logs and enters\nthe huts, making less comfortable the lives of the inmates.\nAs in old Cariboo, so also in Klondike, the miner piles up\ngreat quantities of earth around the walls to keep out the cold\nblast which sweeps down from the north through the valley\nof the Yukon.\nThe buildings of the Commercial Companies are large and\nsubstantial; these have double walls of boards with saw-dust\nbetween.\nAMUSEMENTS.\nThe chief objects of interest are the dance halls and gambling games. Games involving very large sums are running\nnight and day. The loss or gain of a couple of thousands is\nscarcely, noticed.\nThe dance halls open about eight o'clock in the evening\nand the morning is well advanced before the bands and the\nbelles retire and the festivities draw to a close. Gallant beaux,\nequipped in blanket suits and heavy nailed boots grace the\nfloor and pay $1.00 for the luxury.\nDrinks and cigars retail at 50 cents, and such is the thirst-\nfor beer that two breweries cannot supply the demand at $125\na keg.\nSaloons are run \"wide open\" and do not pay a license. The\nindividual who does the honours, in liquidating his debt,\npasses his sack over to the bar-keeper, who usually pours out\nenough dust to settle the amount. There are over sixteen\nsaloons and their receipts are very large.   One is said to have 28\ntaken $60,000 in sixty days last spring, and on the day the\nsuccessful miners took their departure on the first steamer of\nthe season the receipts amounted to $6,500.\nSTORES.\nTogether with the general stores there are barbers's shops,\nlaundries, restaurants, jewellery stores, physicians, a half a\ndozen or so, and real estate offices. The laundries charge\n$1.50 for washing a white shirt and 75 cents for flannels; shaving is 50 cents and a hair-cut $1.00; loaves of bread, and small\nat that, cost 50 cents.\nA drove of cattle arrived in September, and as a consequence two butcher's shops were opened and meat was sold\nat $1.00 a pound, which made work for the solitary dentist,\nwho charges $3.50 to extract a tooth.\nWAGES.\nMechanics receive an ounce of gold for nine hours' work\nand some of them $20 to $25-a day. There was no sign, up to\nSeptember, of any diminution of labourers' wages; they\nreceived from $10 to $15 a day.\nchurches.\nThere are two churches, Catholic and Episcopal, and an\nhospital in charge of ladies of the order of Sisters of Charity.\nGOLD  OUTPUT.\nFrom careful enquiries from the best authorities, the quantity of gold said to have been -taken out of Bonanza and\nEldorado Creeks alone, up to September 1st of last year, would\nweigh not far from five tons, and yet nothing like a fifth of\nthe claims have been properly worked and some hardly prospected. It is hard to realize how plentiful the gold really is\nin some of the claims. Those yielding less than $2,000 or\n$3,000 a day scarcely excite a passing comment.\nAside from the holders of rich claims everybody is in a\nstate of feverish excitement and ready at any moment to make\na grand dash for any new diggings. The slightest rumour of\nth'j discovery of a new creek is enough to cause a stampede,\nand women, not to be outdone, close their stores and join in\nthe wild rush. During these stampedes men rarely take time to\ncook a proper meal.   Off a man will start with nothing more\niLJi 29\nthan a \"slap-jack\" in his fe^^ftS^S^S\ntunes are made by men who work on the lay, that is to say,\nthe ownerT rent out their prospects to the workmen for one\nhalf the gold product.\nST. MICHAEL'S ROUTE.\nThere are, in general, two ways of reaching the Klondike\nThe easier way, but the longer, is entirely by water an<Toccupies about thirty-five days. The traveller, taking ship at Victoria, sails direct for St. Michael, seventy miles from the\nmouth of the Yukon River, a distance of 2,200 miles. Enormous quantities of supplies are shipped here every year for the\ntrading posts and missions on the river. v\u201ei-\u2122\nSteamers drawing four feet of water can ascend the Yukon\nfor a distance of ifsoo miles to the Pelly River, and smafler\nboats, with powerful machinery would be able to pass the Five\nFinger Rapids, and ascend to the head of Teslin Lake .Navigation on the lower part of the river usually opens about the\nfnd of June and closes in the early days of October; the upper\npart of the river is clear of ice a couple of weeks earlier and ice\nLgins to run again about the end of October. For two weeks\nspeeding September 29th of the present year, ice cut off all\nentrance to the river channel: then a hard thaw came, lasting\na few davs. On the 16th of October, at St. Michael, the\nweather indicated that winter had set mm earnest.\nEntering the river, which flows into Behrmg Sea through\nseveral mouths, the greatest north being about sixty-five miles\nfrom the most southern artery, the direction is easterly but\nsoon bends round to the north and follows a general northeast\nbearing for about 200 miles to Nulato, where the river bends\nto the east. About sixty miles further on we come to Melozi-\nkakat From this on the course is a little to the north of east\nto the Tanana River, which enters from the southwest and is\nseveral hundred miles long. Before reaching the Lower Ramparts, abrupt limestone cliffs, Minook Creek is passed. Here\ngold was discovered, giving rise to a mild stampede in 96.\nAt the Shaman Village the river broadens out, and further on\nislands occur, with which the river is thickly dotted for the\nnext seventy or eighty miles.\nFORT YUKON\nnow abandoned, is situated nearly two miles above the\nmouth of the Porcupine, a great stream coming from the\nregion of McKenzie Bay in the north, and is distant from btr\nII 30\nMichael's about 1,300 miles. At the Yukon Flats, a short distance above, the river has practically no confining valley and\nthe bordering plains extend to the horizon on either side,\nunbroken by a single elevation, and having the appearance of\nthe existence, at one time, of a lake basin or an abnormal expansion of the river which is here divided into numberless\nchannels by a labyrinth of islands.\nOwing to the unusual lowness of the water on the flats there\nwere only two small steamers able to make the ascent of the\nriver after August 12th. One of these was the Weave, whose\narrival in Dawson with 160 tons of provisions was hailed with\nrapturous delight.\nNear the head of the islands we pass the camp of Senatee,\nthe most powerful chief in the whole Yukon country, and at\none time a murderous cannibal; but time has now tamed his\nferocious disposition, and a handful of tea is enough to draw\nfrom him a long oration descriptive of his enduring love for\nthe white race.\nCIRCLE CITY.\nThis is the distributing point for the mines of the district\nof Birch Creek, the upper waters of which are reached by a\nportage of six miles to the east. Birch Creek is about 150\nmiles long and runs nearly parallel with the Yukon from the\nbend above the flats. At Fort Cudahy, about 250 miles further up the river, there are several stores and places of amusement. The post is at the mouth of Forty Mile River, said to\nhave a total length of more than 100 miles of which the lower\ntwenty-three are in Canadian territory. Its position on the\nmap is defined by the intersection of the 64th degree of north\nlatitude and 141st degree of west longitude. Its bars have\nyielded a large quantity of gold, one man having taken\n$52,000 in the season of '96. The average value of labour is\n$10 a day, and bars yielding less have been abandoned.\nFifteen miles below Forty Mile Post a large mass of rock-\nstands on the east bank, known as Old Woman's Rock, and\naccording to an Indian legend represents a scolding wife who,\nfor her viciousness, received a powerful blow from her husband that sent her clean across the river, here half a mile\nwide. On her landing she was converted into a mass of rock,\nwhich remains to this day a memorial of the unhappy woman.\nA similar rock on the west side, being known as Old Man's\nRock, testifies to the power of the Shaman (akin to magi),\nand is all that remains of her husband who, seeing the terrible\nresult of his unkindness, it is reasonable to suppose, was petrified with astonishment.    Fort Reliance is about fortv miles 31\nfrom Cudahy and six and a half miles from the Klonjec village at the mouth of the best salmon stream in the whole\nYukon country. It is a small river about forty yards wide at\nthe mouth and of a beautiful blue colour. Lieutenant\nSchwatka, of the United States Navy, named it Deer River,\nbut it is known to the world as the Klondike.\ndai/ton trail.\nThe trail (so far as there is any trail) is from the head of\nthe western arm of Lynn Canal and starts at Portage Cove,\nacross the peninsula to the eastern banks of the Chilcat River,\nthence along the banks of the river for six miles, when it\ncrosses and follows the western bank for about thirty miles to\nKlukwan on the Kleheena River, thence six or eight miles\nto the British line, thence about 150 miles to the Dalton Trading Post on a branch of the Alsec River, thence in a northerly\ndirection about 160 miles to Fort Selkirk at the mouth of the\nPelly River.. This is the favourite route for live stock. There\nis a good deal of timber along the route and large stretches of\nopen grass land are met.\nTHE POOR  MAN'S ROUTE.\nThis is an overland route, for which Kamloops and Ash-\ncroft in the interior of British Columbia, and on the line of\nthe Canadian Pacific Railway, are the outfitting points. The\n, route lies over an old trail from Lac La Hache to Soda Creek\nalong the Fraser River to Quesnelle, thence to a settlement\non Fraser Lake 152 miles further on. In the next stretch of\n135 miles Mud, Nechaco and Blackwater Rivers are crossed,\nseveral Indian settlements are met and excellent grazing for\ncattle can be found. We next come to Stewart and from\nthere to Hazleton it is 235 miles, or as the Indians say, \"it is\ntwenty pounds of fish,\" meaning seven days' travel. From\nHazleton to Glenora is about 200 miles. From this point to\nTeslin Lake the country affords good grazing in the spring\nand early summer, as already mentioned. The distance between these two points over a route recently discovered is said\nto be only 130 miles.\nThe country in the region of the lakes is not now considered\ninaccessible, and if official reports of the United States and\nCanadian authorities, together with the statement of Mr. Xeill\nMcArthur, who spent eight years on the Y'ukon and tributaries, are to be relied upom the country is exceedingly rich.\nBut the old story of scarcity of provisions obliged men to\nabandon their prospects. 32\nMISCELLANEOUS  INFORMATION.\nThe following articles should be included in the outfit: i\nmortar and pestle, i sieve of 40-mesh, 1 magnifying glass, 1\nmagnet, 3 canvas sample bags, 1 compass, 8 lbs. of oakum, 6\nlbs. of pitch, 1 pair rowlocks, 3 lbs. candle wick, pail and\nsaucepan.\nRAIN AND SNOW AT DAWSON CITY,  1896.\nSnow fell four days in January, five in March, four in April,\none in May, two in September, six in November and six in\nDecember. In the same year it rained two days in April, four\nin May, twelve in June, three in July, eight in August, two in\nSeptember, and one in October. The coldest day of the year\nwas January 26th\u201468 degrees., and the warmest days were\nJuly 1st and 2nd\u201481 degrees.\nWORK  ON  THE TRAILS.\nThe material for three aerial cable freight tramways has arrived at Dyea. These facilities for moving freight should\nentirely alter and simplify the mountain climbing ordeal and\nrender the journey to the lakes a far less arduous task.\nWHITE  PASS.\nA large number of men are now at work constructing\nbridges and making a waggon road to the lakes where, it is\nfully expected, steamers will be ready to accommodate the\ngreat rush in the coming spring. The completion of these\nimprovements will so alter the character of the journey as to\nmake a degree of pleasure possible, where toil and trouble\nwere experienced before.\nWHITE  HORSE  RAPIDS.\nA tramway, intended to take boats, passengers and their\nsupplies, is being built around the rapids. A party of experienced men have been engaged for some time piloting miners'\nboats.\nSOME FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY.\nThe country is well timbered along the margin of the river,\nbut inland the ground is covered with what is locally known\nas nigger grass. This is a coarse' grass which falls each year\nand tangles in such a way as to make walking very difficult.\nOn this a scrubby growtfy of trees is found extending up the 33\nmountains. Above the timber line the rocks are bare; the\nminers keep to the top of the ridge when travelling; below the\nrecks are covered with from twelve to fourteen inches of moss.\nProspecting is done in winter. The moss and decayed rubbish is cleared away and fire is applied to burn down to the\nbed-rock. The frost gives way before the fire twelve to sixteen inches in a day. Having burned down to bed-rock, it\nmay be fifteen feet or so below the surface, and found the pay-\nstreak, drifting is started. The upper part is usually barren,\nand the pay dirt lies on the rock beneath, and above it in some\ninstances to a depth of \"four feet.\nThe accompanying map of Alaska and the Northwest Territory, in which the mines are located, shows the Mackenzie\nRiver, referred to in the report of Commissioner Ogilvie, and\nan immense extent of country that has never been explored.\nThe mines so far discovered are the gravel deposits in an\narea of country small compared with all that in which other\ndeposits may be found. So far as thorough prospecting is\nconcerned, the basin of the Yukon has hardly been entered.\nThe tributaries of the Yukon vary in length from 60 to 300\nmiles.\nThat there are possibilities of discoveries of much more\nwealth cannot be doubted.\n' The headwaters of\" the Klondike have not yet been explored owing to the difficulty in getting in provisions. Hunker Creek is held in high esteem. It has two forks, one known\nas Gold Bottom, the other as Last Chance; both are fully\nstaked and each stands well. Too Much Gold Creek (so called\nbecause Indians saw specks of mica at the bottom) enters the\nKlondike fully fifty miles above the mouth, and as high as\nhalf an ounce has been taken out of a prospect hole.\nRecent reports from Sulphur and Dominion creeks confirm\nthe early accounts of their richness. Dominion is longer than\nBonanza and Sulphur is about fifteen miles long with a bottom averaging 600 feet from base to base of hills. Bear Creek\nis said to be as rich as Bonanza below Discovery claim. Prospects 011 Victoria Creek have shown as high as $150 to a pan.\nSkookum Pup promises immensely. This stream enters\nBonanza at No. 26 above Discovery. The two claims were\nsold for $25,000 and a little later $30,000 was taken from the\nlower claim and only three box lengths had been worked.\nThe pay gravel runs thirty feet wide, ten feet deep and about Tj\n34\na mile up the gulch. Eldorado meets Bonanza at No. 7 above\nDiscovery, from which a single clean-up yielded 365^ ounces,\nand claim No. 67 is at the source of the main stream of the\ntributary. It is extremely rich from its mouth to the forks at\nNo. 47.\nA party of twenty-five men, arriving in Victoria as late as\nDecember 3rd from Dawson, bring down astonishing accounts of the output of gold, not only of Bonanza and Eldorado, but also of Sulphur Gulch, Hunker, Gold Bottom and\nLast Chance Creeks. The problem of how to export the full\nvolume of the yellow dust, which has been largely increased\nsince the discovery of Davis, Mosquito, Cricken, Miller,\nGlacier and several other creeks, becomes a really serious one.\nAt a modest calculation there will be twenty-five to thirty-\nfive millions to add to the world's treasure next spring.\nIt may be said that the opinion that ranks these placers\npeerless seems just.\nIndian Creek joins the Yukon midway between the Klondike and Stewart Rivers and all along the creek good pay\"\nhas been found. Further up lies the head of several branches\nof the Stewart on which good prospects have been found.\nGold has been found in several of the streams joining the\nPelly and on the west side above Selkirk some work has been\ndone with good results, and on a\u00abJarge creek, some thirty or\nforty miles below Selkirk, fair prospects have been found, but\nthe difficulty of getting supplies prevented extensive prospecting.\nGold has been found on the head of the Alsec River near\nChilcat Inlet, and all along the Hootalinqua. There is a belt\nof silver-bearing ledges which extends from the Pelly to the\nStickeen. In this region, without doubt one of the richest\nin the entire country, argentiferous galena is known to occur\nin great deposits. A very large percentage of the streams\nbetween the Stickeen and Skeena give placers of $5.00 to $10\na day. From the district of Teslin Lake, where gold quartz\nand especially copper ores abound, to Quesnelle, mineral-bearing ledges have been noted by early explorers.\nFrom what has been said it may be assumed that in all this\ncountry there is gold, while in this particular zone it is especially abundant. This zone lies outside of the Rocky Mountains and distant from them by about 150 miles.\nThere is no doubt that this country offers to men of fortitude\nand steadiness an opportunity to make more money in a given\ntime than they possibly could make anywhere else.\nWith the improved means of transportation new camps\nand towns are springing up like magic. 35\n-CAMP  LIEE.\nGoing into camp the first thing to do is to put up the tent;\nthen a quantity of dry wood is collected to make a fire and\nprepare the hurried camp meal, which usually consists of flapjacks (pan-cakes), bacon and coffee, after which the weary\ntraveller lights his pipe and prepares a spring mattress of\ncedar and spruce boughs on which to spread his blankets or\nsleeping-bag. If he is in a sheltered spot the ice and snow\nand howling wind without will not disturb him.\nA NEW  DISCOVERY.\nThe latest rush was to Dean Creek, heading towards Eldorado and about two miles south of Dawson.\nWOMEN ON THE TRAIL.\nSo far from women being a bar or a hindrance to men, the\nwriter having seen them on the trail, believes they are rather\na help and a spur when difficulties arise. Few men would\nfalter or turn back when a brave woman was leading the way.\nMiss Alice Hyde was met at the summit of the White Pass,\nher face turned towards the wonderland of the North. The\n\"first meadow\" was ahead \u2014a veritable quagmire\u2014but nothing daunted she pushed on and to-day owns a claim having\n\"pay-dirt\" six feet in depth and) twenty-two feet in width.\nWriting from Dawson she says: \"During the month of November the sun only showed his face for about three hours\neach day, but there was twilight for two or three hours longer.\nThe northern lights are very grand, the sky appearing to be\nablaze at times; their beams darting through the air make a\nwhizzing noise and cast a shadow on the ground. It is strange\nthat the lights appear in the South in this latitude.\n\"Once over the mountains the trip was by no means as\nI had been led to believe. When I think of the wildness and\ngrandeur of the scenery along the route, and of being in the\nheart of a country I had only heard of as the home of the\ngrizzly bear, I feel like one in a dream. There are about thirty\nfamilies here. The town is very orderly, but not picturesque.\nLast summer there were only two things more plentiful than\ndogs\u2014mosquitoes and gold dust. The mosquitoes were a\nplague, and no one should be without netting to protect the\nface; the dogs continue a menace to limb by day and a howling horror by night. The people are very kind and seem\nanxious to help one another. No one should come without\nample provisions as it is not considered likely that the transportation companies on the river will be able to bring up suf- 36\nficient supplies for the thousands said to be on the way.\n\"The following list may be of value to those intending to\nmake the trip: 3 suits winter underwear, 1 suit Mackinaw and\nbloomers, 3 pairs wool stockings, 1 undervest (chamois), 1\nwarm dress, 1 short slyrt of heavy material to wear over\nbloomers, 1 pair heavy wool gloves, 2 pair heavy wool mittens,\n1 cap, 1 night dress (flannel), 1 wrapper, snow glasses, 2 pair\nslippers, 1 pair walking shoes, 1 pair felt boots, 4 pair heavy\nstockings, 1 pair gum boots, 4 pair moccassins, 1 warm hood. 4\nsuits summer underwear, 1 suit summer waist and bloomers, 1\ndress (summer), 3 shirt waists, gloves to protect hands from\nmosquitoes, aprons, hat with broad brim to keep netting\naway from face, light night dress.\n\"The following articles should be packed in a box in sufficient quantities for the journey (a month) to prevent opening\nof large packages: Flour, bacon, germea, rice, beans, sugar,\nextract of beef, baking powder, salt, pepper, pilot bread, dried\nfruits, canned beef, chocolate and condensed cream. A separate canvas bag will be found a convenience for the following\narticles of'bedding: 1 feather pillow, 3 pair of good blankets,\n1 piece of canvas, instead of sleeping bag, 1 water-proof sheet,\n1 ready-sewed tick can be filled with dried moss, 1 small hand\nbag for sundries. A lady's outfit for a year will cost at the\nleast $400\u2014this sum will not purchase a good outfit for a man. 37\nCLIMATE OF THE YUKON.\nFrom observations by U.S. authorities in the Autumn of\n'89, the temperature first touched zero on Nov. 4th, and the\nlast zero recorded in the spring of '90 was on April 30th. The\nlowest temperature being 59 \u00b0 below zero on January 1st.\nSnow storms may occur between September and May. In\nJune the sunrises at about 2 a.m. and sets at 10:30 p.m.,\ngiving more than 20 hours of daylight, and twilight the remainder of the time. The mean summer temperature rises to\nbetween 60 \u00b0 and 70 \u00b0 . There is almost a continuous sun in\nsummertime. Evaporation is very slow, owing to the thick\nmoss which will not conduct the heat.\nReport from the Northwest Mounted Police under Staff\nSergt.

The highest temperature in July was\n83 \u00b0 ; rain fell 11 days, and in October 12 days.\nIt may be said winter set in about the end of September.\nZero was first touched on October 5th, and the average temperature of that month was 26 \u00b0 .\nMINER'S CABIN.\nThe miner's cabin is a small affair, about 12x14 feet. The\nroof is heavily earthed and is usually very warm. Miners who\ndo not work their claims in winter, very often, become very\nindolent, only eating those things most easily cooked.      This 38\nmanner of living sometimes leads to scurvy. It is therefore\nbest to procure the most varied outfit of food that can be\nobtained.\n\u2022\nMINER'S OUTFIT.\nIt would be unwise to go to the Yukon placing any dependence on a certainty of obtaining what was required from the\nleading houses in the country. A number of steamers were\nunable to get up the Yukon River with supplies, (as mentioned\nin the notes on the St. Michael's route.) The gold seeker\nshould therefore go prepared to be independent for a year.\nFor convenience the outfit is divided into three parts.\nIt is winter that one must think of in preparing, not summer.\nClothing.\n3 Suits heavy wool underwear.\n3 Heavy wool overshirts.\ni Heavy wool sweater.\n2 Pair trousers, one close-woven for winter wear. Would\nbe improved by cotton batting quilting in seat and\nover thighs and knees.\n2 Pair good overalls, one felt lined,\ni Vest.\ni Sack coat.\n3 Jumpers.\ni Coat (skin preferable with hair on, turned inside) with\nwarm lining and belt,\ni Wide brim hat for summer.\ni Fur cap, large enough to pull down over head and with\nfur-lined ear flaps.\ni Wool neck scarf,\ni Pair heavy nailed boots   for prospecting   on   rocky\nground.\n2 Pair gum boots, leather soled and nail-protected, for\nwork in the cold and marshy ground in winter.\n. 3 Pair seamless felt ankle moccasins,\ni Pair of strong slippers for indoor wear.\n2 Pair heavy blankets (wool.)\ni Fur robe for sled travel and cover at night (sheepskin\nis good and not expensive)\n20 Yards mosquito bar netting for veiling to protect from\nmosquitoes in summer. laBi\ni Sheet rubber water-proof cloth, 12 feet square.\n2 Leather or deer hide packing cases for small articles.\nTowels, etc. 39\ni Set pack straps.\ni Tent,    i sleeping bag.\ni Pair blue goggles to prevent snow blindness.\nIn the matter of food, individual tastes differ, and the range\nof selection is wider than  with the  clothing.    Life  in the\nYukon is not all a picnic.    One going there eats to live.\nl    The following is a good list:\u2014\n300 Pounds flour.\n50       \"     Germea, contains more nutriment than oatmeal, and is very easily prepared.\n15       \"     Rice.\n150       \"     Bacon, boneless, sliced, packed in tins.\n100       \"     Beans.\n80      \"     Potatoes (peeled) evaporated.\n100      <c     Dried fruit, stoned  and peeled, and seedless\nraisins.\n25      B     Dried beef, chipped, in tin.\n25      |     Tea.\n80      |     Sugar.\n5       \\ *     Coffee extract.\nCondensed milk (20 cans).\n75       1     Vegetable biscuits.\n40       \"     Lard.\n5       \\ \\     Beef extract.\n2      * -     Pepper.\n10      p     Baking powder.\n10      |     Salt.\n60      il     Dried soup vegetables.\nMost of the above articles should have water-proof covering.\nAvoid carrying waste\u2014for example,  the bones and rind  of\nbacon, the stones of fruit, etc.  All the articles which are com- .\npressible have compressed.      From the dried soup, vegetables\nand beef extract, a considerable quantity of soup can be made\nat one time, frozen in cakes,  and then used as needed.     To\nprepare it,  thaw and, heat over a fire,   adding  water.    The\npackages should, as near as possible,  be of a uniform weight,\n50 or 70 pounds, otherwise it will be difficult to handle them.\nKITCHEN UTENSILS.\n1 Stove and pipe,  the latter in   flat sheets, with seam\nedge crimped for joining.\n1 Fry pan, with folding handle.\n2 Pots, with cover and bail, sizes to nest together.\n1 Kettle.\n1 Tea pot.\n2 Pans for bread baking, sizes to nest. 40\n2 Soup plates, blue or granite ware.\n2 Cups | |\ni Can opener, knives, forks, spoons.\nAluminum ware is light and easily cleaned.\nTOOLS.\nGold pans, i flask quicksilver.\n3^2 inch pick, with large eye, and one for heavy work,\nhandles.\nShovel.\nAxe.\nHatchet, hammer head, claw,    i\nTimber saw.\nRiphand saw.\nBrace and bits.\nSaw set and file.\nSquare.\nJack plane,\nio pounds 12-penny nails.

Apply ^externally for sore throat,\nuse internally for bowel complaint.\nA combined rifle and shotgun, and ammunition.\nFishing tackle,    ioo feet % inch hemp rope.\nA small roll of surgeon's plaster, antiseptic gauze for dressing wounds, and an assortment of medicines in the form of\npellets and capsules, particularly laxatives and remedies for\ndysentery.\nThis list will look large to men not accustomed to mining\nor out-door life. It is difficult for them to realize the requirements for a year in the frozen North. To some of those who\nnow go in search of gold the reward in the end will prove to\nhave justified their action ; but will it to the many ? Anyway,\nif you must go, go prepared to preserve life and health, and to\nmine without unnecessary waste of time, which in the Yukon\nis both valuable and costly. To accomplish these things, be\nsure in preparing to have as efficient an outfit as money will\nbuy. A dependence on what is being offered as an outfit by\nSan Francisco advertisers and others who know nothing about\nthe requirements is only a form of premeditated suicide. PART 3.\nGeology of the Yukon,\nNotes on Alluvial and Metalliferous\nProspecting,\nRegarding the geology of the Upper Yukon Prof. L,inderman,\nwho explored the region in '73 and'73, says: \"The mineral\nzone extends east and west. The geological formation where\ngold is found is a black slate of the carboniferous age.''\n\" I think the entire country is mineral territory and the\nEastern Alaskan range gold bearing. The placers being\nfound on every stream* leading from the range. I crossed and\nexamined fifty-two streams and rivers and panned gold in all\nof them. I took gold out of the Katrin Hills about 230 miles\nnorth of Cook's Inlet. On Porcupine I found gold and some\nnuggets.\"\n' I The dip rock varies from 11 \u00b0 to 7 \u00b0 . There were\ntremendous ledges of low grade ore that would be profitable\nto big mills.\"\nThis extract from Prof. Iyinderman's report coincides, in a\nwonderful manner, with the report of Boundary Commissioner\nOgilvie, just issued.\nGOLD.\nGold has ever been, from the earliest ages, one of the most\npotent factors in the affairs of men.. In what country or in\nwhat age it was first discovered history does not tell. Some\naccounts point to India, but all are mere conjecture.    Certain v^f 42\nit is however, that it possesses a remarkable influence and a\npower, before which men and even nations bow. With the\ndiscovery of gold cities and civilization spring into being and\neverywhere, as a result, the arts and sciences flourish. Several\ntheories have been advanced to account for its origin, one is\nthat gold in nature is always found associated with silver, and\nthe ratio of gold to silver is not uniform. If silver never\noccurs without some gold it follows that the gold has grown\nfrom the silver, and the varying proportions found in different\nmines are due to the length of time the growth has been going\non. Another writer says, that the scientific world generally\nin later years concedes the fact that the metals are a product\nfrom the solutions precipitated by nature's electrical forces,\nand adds, it is also an ascertained fact that the nearer we\napproach to the North Pole the stronger are the electromagnetic forces precipitated.\nEverywhere the origin of gold is the same. It is liberated\nfrom its rock matrix by the natural processes of the erosive\nagencies of frost and disintegration, and is placed where found\nby glacial action or by running water. The action of frost is\nprincipally in breaking the lodes in place into fragments, the\ngrinding together of these fragments in the streams and\ngradually wearing away liberates the gold. Once freed it\nworks its way downward to bedrock, while its once rock\nmatrix is carried on as sand to the sea.\nALLUVIAL PROSPECTING.\nThe water washing away gold-bearing matter carries the\nlighter particles down the stream while the heavier\nparticles are left behind. The point where the stream changes\ndirection is very often the richest. The sides of swift currents\nand the inner rim of curves should be examined. Where, an\naccumulation of gravel occurs on the slope of a hill or along\nthe course of a stream where gold has been found, a portion\nof it should be \"panned \" as it may contain rich runs of gold\nnear the bedrock.\nWherever drift matter may be found or supposed to exist,\ndo not neglect it though it be covered with vegetation. The\ndeposits of rich alluvial matter found in the tributaries of the\nKlondike were covered with twelve and fourteen inches of\nmoss. Along the course of a river there may be many bends,\nthese bends are much more likely places to find rich deposits\nthan where the stream is straight. In ages gone by the\ngold-bearing drifts may not have followed the existing course\nof streams, but may have been at an angle to the present\nchannels,   wherever   these   old  channels   are found  careful 43\nsearch should be made and an endeavour to trace them from\nthe points where the present streams cut away. The trouble\ntaken in this work is often well repaid by the discovery of\nrich diggings. Not only should the beds of streams and dry\ncreeks at the bottom of valleys be examined, but the characteristics of loose rocks in gulches and ravines should be\nobserved. Eddies and water holes are likely places, and\nshould the body of water in a stream be too great it must be\nturned by digging trenches.\nThe appliances used in prospecting are the pick, shovel and\npan.\nTo \"pan out\" gold.\nThe operation is very simple yet it requires some skill.\nFill the pan with gravel or other matter, as you find it\nwhere working. Then pour in water and shake round about\nand from side to side, allowing all soluble matter to pass\nover the edge.    This is done by tilting the pan to one side.\nIt is convenient to have two pans or else a second vessel,\nso as to save time. In this way the rough'work can be done\nrapidly, the fine stuff containing gold being thrown together\nand washed carefully over the other pan, the prospector\nkeeping in mind the number of pans. A heaped pamload\nweighs about twenty pounds, so that one pan represents the\niooth part of a short ton. The size of a gold pan used in\nCalifornia is about twenty inches circumference and four or\nfive inches deep.\nTHE AVERAGE VALUE OF GOLD.\nA grain of pure gold is worth a little less than 4^ cents.\nThe average of gold from many placers is about 3^ cents per\ngrain. About 1% yards of gravel when dug is equal to one\nyard before being dug. Several pans of dirt can be measured\nand the number to the yard determined. In sinking shafts\nfor testing purposes energy should not be wasted in making\nthem too large, 2^ feet is large enough for considerable\ndepths.\nTHE METHOD  OE REACHING PAY-DIRT.\nIt is always the case that pay-dirt\u2014dirt containing gold\u2014\nlies next to the rock. This being the case it is necessary to\nclear away the gravel or dirt that lies between the surface and\nthe bed-rock.\n'In the Klondike the ground is frozen to a depth of between\n10 and 20 feet. To reach the bed-rock large fires are made\u2014\nwood is plentiful\u2014this naturally thaws out the frost. The\nbed-rock being   reached  and sufficient  pay being found to 44\nwarrant a continuance of the'work, the prospector then commences tunnelling or drifting. The dirt then removed is\nhoisted to the top and placed on the dump to await the coming\nof spring.\nThis method of thawing out the frozen ground enables the\nminer to remove the pay-dirt, thus doing away with the long\nperiod of idleness.\nWASHING THE PAY-DIRT.\nAfter working until April or May the water begins to run.\nThen the timber is prepared and the sluice boxes put in.\nSLUICE  BOXES.\nAfter the course of the water is turned along the hill-side,\na dam is built and sluice boxes erected. These boxes consist\nof a series of wooden troughs, having a suitable inclination,\nacross the inside of the bottom small strips of wood are fixed.\nIf the gold is fine the grade is slight, if coarse a greater pitch\nis given. By making one end of the box narrower than the\nother end, they can be made to fit one into the other, thus\nmaking a sluice of any length desired. The earth is then\nthrown in and the running water washes it away leaving the\nparticles of gold in front of the bars on the bottom of the\nsluice boxes.\nROCKERS.\nWhen it happens that a claim is too far from water, a rocker\nis used. The rocker is just what its name indicates. The\ndirt is placed within it and it is rocked until the dirt and gold\nhave been shaken apart.\nPROSPECTING FOR MINERAL-BEARING ORES.\nNo advantage would come to the prospector from a discussion of the origin of mineral-bearing ores, but it is well\nsomething should be known of their depositions.\n* It is a generally accepted belief that in creation's early days\nthe earth was a molten mass, and that the metalliferous ores\nwere ejected from the interior by volcanic action/ through\nfissures in the outer crust formed by a more or less lengthy\nperiod of cooling.\nIn any particular district mineral lodes usually follow the\nsame direction and will be found to run parallel. In some\ndistricts a second series occur and run right across the first,\nbut these are generally less rich and are of a different nature\nof mineral. 45\nPROSPECTING.\nProspecting on the hills may be done with comparative ease\nif the country is exposed, by observing the outcrops and\ntracing them to lower ground. The sides of valleys, land\nslips, cliffs, gulches and canons exposed to view by the action\nof water should be studied carefully. On rough ground the\ndirection of a lode will appear crooked.\nIf j float \" (fragments of mineral-bearing rock) occurs the\nprospector should follow it up, \"panning\" as he goes until\nhe ceases to find any more float and the indications of colour\nin the pan lessen, then skirmish on the side or end hills for a\nlode, remembering that the float was washed down according\nto the law of gravity. If he succeeds it is not likely to be\nisolated, it may represent many more richer or poorer in the\ndistrict.\nLong exposure to the weather may have rendered the float\nquite barren, while the mother lode may be very rich. The\nnearer to the lode the more angular and less worn it is. The\nbetter locations for the occurrence of mineral deposits are at\nor near the contact of two different formations. Notice sudden\nchanges and faults in the ridge. Search should be made for\nthe rock known to be the matrix of veins. The matrices are\nfluor spar and calc spar, but quartz is the most general. When\nthe float is found to be honeycombed and stained a reddish\nbrown by iron oxide, it is considered an excellent indication.\nExposure to the atmosphere decomposed the iron or copper\npyrites and stained the rock. When such rock is found no\nexperienced miner will neglect the opportunity of having it\ntested. If he submits it to the camp expert, his opinion may\nbe no more reliable than the average weather prophet. The\nbest plan is to have an assay made by a competent authority,\nbut the miner may make a test himself which, with some\npractice, may give fair results.\nThe prospector should become familiar with the appearance\nof the oxides in the outcrop as they indicate the nature of the\nsulphides in the rock beneath.\nHOW   TO   DISTINGUISH  THE  PRECIOUS METALS.\nSilver is white, but when found on the surface is usually\ntarnished ; it can be flattened by beating and is easily cut; the\nore usually contains a percentage of gold and copper. It is\nfound in limestone, sandstone, trap, porphyry and slate; its\ngangue is usually quartz, fluor spar and calc spar. Silver\nglance (sulphide of silver) is usually found along with copper 46\nlead, iron, zinc, antimony, etc.; its colour is greyish or blackish;\nin the sunlight it has a bright lustre. It is soft and is fusible\nat a very low temperature.\nIf silver-bearing ores be heated in the fire and dropped into\nwater drops of the metal will appear on the surface.\nStrenuous efforts are being made by the Bi-metallic League\nin the United States, England and other countries to advance\nthe price of silver, but unfortunately the best efforts have so\nfar proved unavailing. The prospector, however, should not\nbe indifferent to silver-bearing ores. Chloride of silver (horn\nsilver) found in some districts\u2014notably in the Slocan and\nTrail districts of B.C.\u2014contains a very large percentage of the\nmetal. This is a soft mineral looking like horn or wax and cutting like it ; occurs (often with carbonate of lead) in the upper\nparts of lodes.\nOres of copper occur in every age and in lodes and deposits.\nThe oxide stain of decomposed pyrites containing copper is\nblack, unless iron is present; the ores can be cut with a knife.\nA boiling solution of nitrate of soda and citric acid will dissolve copper p3^rites. The solution will cover a steel blade\nwith a copper film. To test copper ores in camp, roast and\ndrop while hot into grease. When exposed to a flame a green\ncolour may be seen if copper is present. Native copper is\nfound in tree-like and fanciful shapes\u2014colour red. The ore\nusually carries gold and silver.\nLead.\u2014The ores of lead, like copper, occur in many rocks,\nsome of which are limestone, granite, sandstone, &c. Galena\nand carbonate (white lead ore) are the principal ores of lead.\nThey are often very rich in silver. Galena is easily known by\n\u00bbits bright appearance when cut. Carbonate is of a dull colour\nand when broken up is like clay or earth.\nCOMPOSITION OF ROCKS.\nThe first rocks formed were the lower crystalline, Archaean\ngranite, and, as the earth cooled, solidified, forming a crust\nand, owing to the shrinkage of the interior, cracked and\nthrough these cracks streams of the molten matter poured.\nThen through disintegration aided by the destructive agency of\ncarbonic acid gas, began the slow process of forma don of sedimentary rocks, which in turn, from pressure and other causes,\nwere to harden into rocks.\nRocks consist essentially of minerals, and the minerals of\nthe common rocks are of four groups: i. Quartz, called in\nchemistry silica; 2. silicates or compounds of silica; 3.\ncarbon ;   4.   carbonates, or compounds of carbon. 47\nQuartz is the commonest of all species and is one of the\nhardest minerals. Most sandstones and conglomerates consist largely of quartz (nearly every colour, generally white or\nbrownish.)\nFragmental rocks include sandstones, shales and conglomerates. Stratified rocks are in beds and sedimentary are deposited as a sediment out of the decomposition and washing\ndown of the rocks of the age preceding.\nCrystalline Rocks.\u2014Some metamorphic, some igneous meta-\nmorphic rocks are those changed by heat or pressure; examples,\nmarble, mica, schist, gneiss and much granite, &c.\nIgneous rocks have come up melted through volcanic\nfissures from the heated interior of the earth; they include\nlavas, porphyry and granite.\nPorphyritic rocks are those having distinct feldspar crystals.\nSandstones are made up of particles of sand cemented\ntogether; colour gray, brown, white, red, &c;\nConglomerate. \u2014Consolidated gravel.\nSlate.\u2014A slaty rock imperfectly formed (schists applied to\ncertain slaty rocks.)\nMetamorphic Rocks.\u2014Granite, a crystalline rock of quartz,\nfeldspar and mica or hornblende : colour light or dark gray.\nGneiss\u2014Is like granite in construction, and is made up of\nthe same minerals as granite, only containing them in parallel\nlayers.\nNATURE OF A FEW MINERALS.\nSchists\u2014Mica schist consists of fine layers of quartz and\nmica ; talc\" schist, fine layers of quartz and talc ; chlorite\nschist, fine layers of quartz and chlorite; hornblende schist,\nfine layers of quartz and hornblende.\nFeldspar\u2014Colour usually white or red, sometimes gray,\nblack or green, so very hard will scratch glass.\nTalc\u2014A greenish, yellowish white, or sometimes colourless\nmineral of a pearly or resinous lustre. Is greasy to the touch,\nsoft, yields to the finger nail.\nChlorite\u2014A dark green, generally foliated and scaly mineral.\nHornblende\u2014Of many varieties, mostly greenish black,\nand also whitish colour.\nFluor-spar\u2014Is usually purple, sometimes yellow, white,\ngreen or blue. If heated in a dark place a phosphorescent\nlight appears, not unlike a precious stone.    It is soft.\nCalc-spar^-(Carbonate of lime) generally transparent, and\nof a gray-rose, honey-yellow or violet shade.\nI 48\nMINE SURVEYING.\nMineral Deposits\u2014The deposit rests on the foot-wall and\nthat covering the deposit is the hanging wall. These are\nknown as the floor and roof respectively.\nThe Strike or Course of a Deposit\u2014Is the angle formed\nwith the plane of the lode and the plane of the horizon. Its\ndip is the inclination downward measured in degrees from the\nhorizontal. When the dip is great it is measured from the\nvertical and is then termed the underlie or hade.\nOut-crop\u2014The portion of the mineral deposit at the surface\nis known as the out-crop or apex.\nCross Courses\u2014These are veins coursing at nearly right\nangles to the chief lodes of any particular district.\nA Shaft\u2014Is a pit sunk down from the surface.\nLevels\u2014Are horizontal excavations along the course of a\nvein, or horizontal passages by which access is gained to\nworkings of a mine.\nA Slope\u2014Is a working from which the ore is extracted.\nAbove a level the working is an overhead or back slope. An\n1 I underhand '' slope is the working downward from the floor\nof the level.\nCALCULATION OF AREAS.\nGunter's chain, 66 feet long, is most frequently used in\nmeasuring lengths. liBS\nTo find the area in a piece of Ground :\ni. If rectangular, multiply the length by the breadth.\n2. If triangular, multiply the base by half the perpendicular\nheight.\nSOLID OR CUBIC MEASURE.\n1728 cubic inches equal 1 cubic foot\n27        \" \u25a0   feet      \"     1    \"    yard\n4 feet x 4 feet x 8 feet=i28 cubic yards...    \"    1 cord wood\nTROY MEASURE.\n24 grains equal 1 pennyweight (dwt.)\n20 pennyweights      \"    1 ounce (oz.)\n12 ounces      \"    1 pound (lb.)\nStandard gold consists of 22 parts pure gold alloyed with\ntwo parts copper or other metal, and according to the quantity\nof alloy is called 9, 12, 15, or 18 carat\u2014i.e> that number of\nparts of gold out of 24. Standard silver is of finest 11 oz.\n2 dwts. fine to 18 dwts. alloy. 49\nA cubic foot of pure gold weighs 1,210 lbs., pure silver 655\nlbs., cast iron 450 lbs., copper 550 lbs., lead 710lbs., platinum\n1,220 lbs.\nA ton weight of the following will average in cubic feet:\nearth 21, clay 18, river sand 19.\nLOCATING CLAIMS.\nThe method of locating a placer claim is simple. The\nprospector must not exceed 100 feet up and down the creek,\nin the general course of the valley. The width of the claim\ncan run from base to base of the hills. If there are no claims\nlocated on this particular stream, the claim is known as the\n\" discovery claim,\" and the stakes are marked O. The next\nclaim up the creek is marked No. 1, as is the next going down\nthe stream. There can be but two claims marked No, 1 on\nany one stream.    Discoverer's claim may be 500 feet.\nEvery miner and employer of a miner will require to take out\na license, the fee for which will be $10. In case of a company it\nwill be $50 or $100, according to the amount of the capital stock.\nThe fee for recording and renewing mining claims will be $15.\nA royalty of 10 per cent on the gold mined will be collected\nby the government if the claim produces $2,500 per year;\nsmaller claims are exempt.\nIf a prospector should locate a claim on any creek or river on\nhis way to Dawson, he will not have a legal title to it unless\nhe is in possession of a license. The towns in which certificates\nare issued are Victoria, the Provincial capital of British Columbia; Vancouver, the terminus of the C.P.R., andNanaimo,\nthe chief seat of the coal industry of the coast. From these\npoints steamers run to the North.\nThe Mining Regulations are not printed here, as it is\nexpected they will undergo some change in the early spring\nof i8q8.\nTHE CUSTOMS STATIONS.\nOn the routes to Dawson City are Glenora, head of navigation on the Stickine River, Lake Tagish, about 72 miles\nfrom the coast, Fort Selkirk, on the Pelly River, a post near\nKlukwan, on the Dalton Trail, and Dawson City.\nInvoices of goods should be produced in duplicate when\nthey are purchased, and collections will be made in accordance\nwith prices therein named,   not on the value of the goods 50\nwhere the collection is made. On most goods subject to\nad valorem duty, the weight of the receptacle is included and\nassessed the same as the coutents.    The exceptions are :\u2014\nMiners' blankets in use, personal clothing in use, cooking\nutensils in use, such quantities of each as will make the\nowner comfortable for a reasonable time.\nAll kinds of machinery imported exclusively for the mining\nof ores, free.\nThe duties on the most important articles are:\u2014Flour, .60\nper barrel; beans, .15 per bushel; bacon, .2 per pound; meat\nand meat extracts, .25 ad valorem; and tobacco, .50 specific. COMMISSIONER OGILVIE'S  LECTURE\nOn the History, Resources and Probable Future of the Yukon Country.\nThe distinguished explorer, Wm. Ogilvie, F.R.G.S., of the\nAlaska Boundary Commission, having returned to Victoria\nafter an absence of several years in the North, addressed a\npublic meeting on November 5th, on the subject of the Yukon\nGoldfields. As no other report of equal weight and importance, on this subject, has reached the outside world, the following extracts from the lecture will be read with interest as an\nauthoritative statement of facts.\nAfter describing the routes he said :\nIn 1872, September 2nd, two Irishmen named Harper and\nF, W. Hart and Sam Wilkinson an Englishman, left Manson\nCreek to go on a prospecting trip down the Mackenzie River.\nThey made their way down to Nelson River, where they made\na cache and a dug-out with which to descend the river.\nIn 1891, he, Mr. Ogilvie, was sent by the Dominion to the\nNortheast portion of the Province, and going in the trail followed by Harper saw the cache they had told him about in\n1887. Harper and his companions made their way down to\nthe Liard River, where Wilkinson left them, and then down\nthe Mackenzie across to the Peel and thence over to Bell's\nRiver, an affluent of the Porcupine, down the Porcupine to\nFort Yukon, (380 miles from Dawson) and up to White\nRiver a distance of 400 miles, where they found some gold.\nThe result of their prospecting was as follows: On the Nelson,\nnothing; on the Liard, colours; on the Mackenzie, nothing;\non the Peel, fair prospects; on the Porcupine, colours; and\nprospects everywhere along the Yukon. Provisions giving\nout they made their way down the Yukon to St. Michael's.\nNext summer Harper returned and built Fort Reliance,\nsix and-a-half miles from the Klondyke, and for many years\ntraded and hunted, but never prospected on that river,\nand if he had he would not have found anything, for it is a\nswift mountain stream which has washed away all the fine sand\nand gravel, consequently the gold would sink out of sight,\ni 52\nand in those days no prospecting was done but on the bars\nin the rivers and creeks.\nIn 1882 gold was found on the Stewart River, and in 1886\nHarper established a trading post at Fort Selkirk, and in the\nsame year some prospectors found gold at Forty-mile, (so\ncalled because it is forty miles from Fort Reliance).\nThis took all the miners up to Forty-mile, coarse gold being what every miner is looking for, and the excitement continued to draw till 1891, when gold was found on Birch Creek,\nsix miles from Circle City and nearly 200 miles below Forty-\nmile.\nThis discovery of course boomed Birch Creek and in 1891\neveryone went down there.\nGold was found at the head of Forty-mile on Napoleon\nGulch and was rich in nuggets. Franklin Gulch is pretty\nrich as are also David, Mosquito and Chicken Creeks. The\nlast named was discovered in 1896 and was considered very\nrich until overshadowed by Eldorado and Bonanza.\nDISCOVERY OF GOLD ON THE KLONDIKE.\nThe discovery of gold on the Klondike (Indian name Tron-\ndak, of diuck) was made by three men, Robert Henderson,\nFrank Swanson and another named Munson, who in July,\n1896 were prospecting on Indian Creek. They proceeded\nup the creek until they reached Dominion Creek, and then\ncrossed over the divide and found gold bottom, got good prospects and went to work.\nProvisions running short they made their way to Sixty-mile\nto obtain a fresh supply, where Harper had established abrading post. Striking upwards to Forty-mile they came across a\nCalifornian, George Carmack, and Two Canadian Indians, or\nKing George men,* as they called themselves.\nNow one of the articles of the miner's code of procedure is\nthat when he makes a discovery he shall lose no time in proclaiming it, and the man felt bound to make the prospectors\nacquainted with the information that there was rich pay to be\ngot in Gold Bottom. The two Indians showed a route to\nthis creek and from there they crossed over the high ridge to\nBonanza (two miles from the mouth of the Klondike.)\nFrom there to Eldorado, which joins the Bonanza about\nmidway, its length is three miles, they climb over the ridge\nand went to Gold Bottom, (twelve miles above the mouth of\n^Canadian Indians are called King George men to distinguish them\nfrom those of the United States. 53\nthe Klondike. Here they did half a day's prospecting, and\ncame back, striking into Bonanza about ten miles beyond\nwhere they they took out from a little nook in a few pans.\n$12.75 0^2 I2S0-\nIn August, 1896, George Carmack went down to Forty-\nmile to get provisions. He met several miners on his way\nand told them \"of his find, showing the $12.75 which he had\nput in an old Winchester cartridge.\nWell, that tells the story of the discovery of the creeks, that\nhave excited and will continue to excite thousands for many a\nday to come.\nA STAMPEDE.\n\" Boatload after boatload of men went up at once. Men\nwho had been drunk for weeks in fact had been tumbled into\nthe boats and taken up without being conscious that they\nwere travelling. One of these only woke up when he was a\nthird of the journey, and he owns one of the best claims on\nthe Klondyke to-day.\nThe whole creek, a distance of about twenty miles, giving in\nthe neighbourhood of about 200 claims was staked in a few\nweeks. Eldorado Creek, eight miles long, providing eighty\nclaims, was staked in about the same time.\nBoulder, Adams and other gulches were prospected, and\ngave good surface showings, gold being found in the gravel\nin the creeks. Good surface prospects may be taken as an\nindication of the existence of very fair bedrock. It was in\nDecember, 1896 that the character of the diggings was established. \" Twenty-one,\" above Discovery on Bonanza, was\nthe one which first proved the value of the district. Claim\nNo. 5, Eldorado was the next notable one here, a pan of $112\nwas taken out. There was then a pan of even greater amount\non No. 6, and they continued to run up every day. The news\nwent down to Circle City, which emptied itself at once and\ncame up to Dawson City.. The miners travelled at all hours\nof the day and night, some with provisions, some without.\"\nAREA OF THE GOLD FIELDS.\nBonanza and Eldorado Creeks afford between them 278\nclaims; the several affluents will yield as many more, and all\nof these claims are good. Mr. Ogilvie had no hesitation in\nsaying that about 100 of those on Bonanza will yield upwards\nof $30,000,000. Claim 30, below on Eldorado, will yield a million in itself; then others will yield from $100,000 up.   These (W\n54\ntwo creeks will, he was quite confident, turn out from $60-,\n000,000 to $70,009,000, and he could safely say that there\nwas no other region in the world of the same extent that has\noffered in the*same length of time so many homestakes\u2014\nfortunes enabling the owners to go home and enjoy the\nremainder of their days. He would state a fact, he said, and\none that was easily demonstrated, which was that we had in this\nprovince an area of from 550 to 600 miles in length and from\n100 to 150 miles in width, over the whole of which prospects\nhad been found, and we had from 90,000 to 100,000 square\nmiles which, with better facilities for the transportation of\nfood, would be the largest, as it was the richest, goldfield the\nworld had ever, known.\nStewart and Pelly Rivers, in the gold-bearing zone, also\ngive promising indications. Everywhere good pay had been\nfound on the bars, and there was no reason why when good\npay was obtained on the bars the results should not be richer\nin the creeks.\nRICH  QUARTZ  LOCATED.\nIn regard to quartz claims, seven have already been located\nin the vicinity of Forty Mile and Dawson, and there was also\na mountain of gold-bearing ore in the neighbourhood yielding from $5.00 to $7.00 a ton. It may be mentioned here that\nthe great Douglas Island quartz lode yields about $2.50 per\nton, but it is on the coast, the other inland.\nTHE MOTHER LODE.\nA party arriving as recently as the 9th of December report\nthe discovery of a quartz ledge which is said to have been\ntraced through a number of rich mining streams of the district. If this should prove to be the mother lode of the\nwealth of Eldorado, the permanency of the Upper Yukon as\na great mining camp will be assured for years to come. ftk\nLAST WRITINGS FROM THE DIARY\nOF THE\nLATE ARCHBISHOP SEGHERS.\nAddressed to Vicar-General Jonckaw, Victoria, B.C.\nNOTES ON FULLER'S CONDUCT WRITTEN IN\nFRENCH.\nThe very interesting story told by the missionary archbishop who, while carrying the message of Christianity into .\na remote and unexplored land, met with a sad and tragic end,\nwill have another interest for the traveller to the Yukon, that\nof being a faithful record of a journey fraught with many\nhardships and some dangers.\nThe Archbishop left Victoria, as he tells us, in July '86, full\nof hope for the success of his mission, and proceeding on his\nway crossed the mountains and reached the upper waters of\nthe Yukon at Lake Bennett, where he wrote the following\naccount of his travel:\u2014\n\"It was on July 13th (1886) as you know,\" the diary reads,\n\"that I left Victoria to establish a permanent mission in the\nheart of this territory and carry out the design I had conceived during.my first exploration of the Yukon country in\n1877 for the Christianizing of the natives.\n\"Two routes lay before us, either the mouth or the headwaters of the Yukon. I went to Alaska through the mouth\nof the Yukon in 1877. This time I chose the other route\u2014\nfirst, because, though the mouth of the river is easy of access,\nyet the navigation of the river up stream is long, tedious and\ndifficult, whereas the trip from Victoria to the headwaters of\nthe Yukon is almost one straight line a little more than 1,000\nmiles and lasted only thirteen days. It is true the portage\nacross the Coast Range and some of the rapids is  a  labour\nU 56\nof the most exhaustive kind, but those difficulties once overcome navigation down the Yukon River from one end of\nAlaska to the other is free from toil and danger, and comparatively pleasant.\n\"We left Juneau on Monday, July 18th at 7 p.m.. Next\nmorning we were steaming up Lynn Canal, which is flanked\nby ranges of lofty peaks, each gorge of which is filled with a\nglacier almost to the edge of the salt water. The. Indians left\ntheir former village on the Chilcat Inlet and built up a new\none on the Chilcoot Inlet, making more than a living by packing for white men. They extort as much money\nasvthey can from every miner that crosses the country. Not\nonly did they charge $13 per 100 pounds, but they made us\npay them for guiding us, for ferrying us across the river, for\nlooking after our safety and that of our packs, as they termed\nit, and then they exacted a 'present' for having faithfully stuck\nto their bargain.\n\"All arrangements being made, we started for the Chilcoot\nvillage in a canoe and reached the mouth of a small river\ncalled the Taiay. Here we met a most kindly disposed\nHibernian, named Healey, who placed us under many and lasting obligations. Finally we left Healey's place and salt water\nnavigation to ascend the rugged and lofty slope of the Coast\nRange, and to force our way through a pass into the basin of\nthe Yukon. We formed a numerous party. Besides the five\nof us there were five miners and some sixty Indian packers,\nsome with over a hundred pounds on their backs, but all in\ngood spirits and great glee to begin our wearisome and arduous trip. It was Saturday, July 24th, the feast of Saint Fran-\nciscus Solano, whose mass I had celebrated in the morning.\nA fleet of canoes conveyed most of our baggage to the head of\ncanoe navigation, some seven miles from Healey's place, but\nwe had to walk. We first waded through the tributary of the\nTaiay, where we had the water to our thighs and were subsequently carried by canoes five times across the Taiay and.\nmoved into our camp early in the afternoon, the water being\njudged too high by the Indians to be forded. We said good\nbye to our canoes and slept soundly all night and prepared\nourselves the following morning for the two worst crossings\nof the Taiay, in one of which a traveller lost his life last summer.-   The first crossing was pretty rough.\n\"Advancing cautiously with heavy gum boots over gravel\npebbles and large boulders through the swift current of a\nseething, foaming torrent, nerving myself to the utmost to\nsustain the powerful velocity  of the liquid  element which SIPSM\n57      **.**\u00a3\nseemed at every moment to lift me from my feet, I reached the\nopposite bank, having had the water well nigh to my hips, but\n^though the water was icy cold, covered with perspiration and\npanting for breath and my heart beating violently. A f^w\nminutes were spent in drying ourselves from our drenching,\nafter which we directed our steps to the next crossing, which\nwe found worse than the former. Here we stood at the mouth\nof the Canon, from which the Taiay, nearly fifty feet wide,\nburst forth at the rate of thirteen miles an hour. Some of the\nIndians formed a chain, taking each other by the hand and\nmarching in a line which extended downward with the current. Preceded by an Indian packer and followed by another,\nI resolutely marched\nOUT INTO THE TORRENT\nwhich seemed as if boiling around me. I was Very successful until I found myself within a few yards of the other bank,\nwhen the velocity of the water forced my feet so wide apart\nthat I felt I could hold the ground no longer. One of my\nknees bent in spite of me, notwithstanding all the efforts I\nmade to brace myself up against the whirling, dashing torrent. One of the Indians saw the danger I was in and reached\nme his hand, and so I found my way out of the wild and furious stream. All of my companions behaved most gallantly\nand appeared to encounter less trouble and difficulty than I\nexperienced. We now entered the narrow gorge through\nwhich the Taiay flows, marching most of the time due north\nand on the right or eastern bank, going up stream of the river.\nWe crossed it again and again, passed several of the tributaries, sometimes on logs, at others wading through the water.\n\"At last, about 6 p.m., wearied and hungry, we arrived at\nthe foot of the glacier, the principal feeder, I presume, of the\nTaiay, and there we saw a splendid camping place made by\nNature, consisting of immense boulders so arranged that they\n; gave perfect shelter both from wind and from rain. This place\nis called Sheep Camp, because I suppose it used to be the\nfavourite resort of mountain sheep, and in one part of it the\nboulders were so ingeniously placed alongside of one another\nthat they form a perfect hiding place, called by the Indians\n'Stone House.'\n\"The next morning, July 26th, we were all up at four\no'clock and left Sheep Camp a little after six full of courage\nand eagerness to reach and pass the summit. Here the ascent\nbecame very steep until we stood at the foot of an almost perpendicular wall formed of rocks, boulders and stones of every \t\n: = \u2014    \" \u2014\n58\ndescription, the top of which appeared to be lost in the\nclouds. It was a novel sight to see our Indian packers ascending the natural ladder, clambering the best they could, helping themselves with poles and now and then with their hands,\nand appearing at some distance as if standing one on the head\nof the other, the highest ones disappearing in the fog. The\nsummit is said to be 3,800 feet high. We reached it at six\no'clock p.m. The view is decidedly beautiful. To the south\nwe commanded the view of the Canon through which we had\npainfully travelled, the snow-capped mountains on the side of\nLynn Canal forming the background. East and west of us\nwere high peaks, which, however, were hid from our sight by\nclouds and thick fog, and north of us lay the extensive country of the Yukon, and a red looking peak touring above the\nrest of the mountains, the foot of which, as we saw afterwards,\nwas\nWATERED BY THE GREAT RIVER\nof Alaska. At our feet lay a carpet of snow and ice of dazzling\nwhiteness, and below still, a beautiful lake, with azure water\nand the edges covered with ice. If, as it appears reasonable,\nwe consider that lake\u2014Crater Lake\u2014as the source of the\nYukon, then it is a remarkable coincidence that I saw the\nYukon the first time this year on the same feast that I did in\n1877, *ne feast of St. Anne.\"\nIn that year the Archbishop went into the country from St.\nMichael's at the mouth of the Yukon. His reason, he said,\n\"in coming this way lay in the object he had in view of visiting new regions and of exploring countries never before\nvisited, and labouring among natives never preached to by\nmissionaries of any denomination.\n\"Great care was needed to pass the snow and ice, which\nformed a steep incline from the edge of the mountain to the\nedge of the lake.. A single mis-step would have sent us sliding down, and once started, there was no possibility of stopping before reaching\" the edge of the lake below. Fortunately,\nby extreme caution, we avoided all accidents and got safely\nover the. dangerous spot. We had scarcely got over the summit when we met two white men returning for their sled,\nwhich we had noticed a few minutes before.\n\"These two men had been abandoned before reaching the\nsummit by their Indian packers and were now themselves\nattending to their own packing, and as I afterwards saw, they\ngot along remarkably well. After marching down the hill,\neither on the bank of the river that flows out of the Crater 59\nLake or at a short distance from it, we reached the shores of\na small lake\u2014Linderman Lake\u2014some six miles long by one\nmile wide, and camped at the mouth of the river we had been\nfollowing all day long. It was about 3 p.m. when we reached\nthe lake, having made in a little less than three days a trip\nof only twenty nine miles from Healey's Camp at the mouth of\nthe Taiay. Next day a serious disappointment happened to\nus. Antoine Prevost, who had followed us from Juneau and\non whom we relied to help us in building a raft, left us and\ndisappeared without saying a word. Fortunately three of the\nminers with whom we had travelled most generously offered\ntheir services to help in building a raft and took on their own\nthat part of our luggage which two Indians had left behind,\nafter taking the rest to the foot of Linderman Lake. Here\nthat you may the better understand our movements I ought\nto describe\nTHE RUN OF THE RIVER.\nCrater Lake, as I have already mentioned, lies this side, that\nis, northeast of the divide, and is the first reservoir containing\nwater that empties into the Behring Sea, a distance of more\nthan 2,000 miles the way the river flows. From this lake an\nimpetuous torrent rushes foaming through a narrow channel\nand empties into Linderman Lake, which is fed also by another farther west. There is a northwest current in this lake\nplainly visible, and it finds its outlet through a narrow pass\nin'which the water furiously dashes over rocks and flows' into\nBennett Lake. The river furnishing the link between Bennett\nLake and Linderman is less than a mile long. It is not safely\nnavigable and is consequently avoided by a portage called\nPerrier Portage. Lake Bennet, some twenty-seven miles\nlong, discharges itself through a short river into Lake Nares,\nand this one into Tagish Lake, after which the river runs\nswiftly through narrow canons until it reaches Lake Le Barge.\nPast Lake Le Barge the river follows a uniform course, receiving several very large tributaries, until after uniting itself\nwith Stewart River, it definitely receives the name Yukon and\nflows placidly toward the Behring Sea.\n\"I left our camp and our party at the head of Linderman\nLake in a small canoe with two Indians to remain at the foot\nof the same lake some six miles distant and to keep an eye on\nthe baggage which those Indians had already conveyed there\nin their canoes. The next day Father Robaut joined me,\narriving also in a canoe and bringing my altar so that on the\nfollowing morning, for the first time, I had the happiness to \u2014 .-\u2014-\nH\n60\ncelebrate the holy sacrifice of the mass on the headwaters of\nthe Yukon where I believe no mass had ever been celebrated\nbefore.\n\"But where was I ? Was I still in Alaska, inside of the line\nthat runs parallel with the coast, or was I in the vicarate apostolic of British Columbia, or in my own diocese in the far\nend of the Northwest Territories of the Dominion? This is\ndifficult to determine. At all events, before leaving the place\nI nailed to a tree the following inscription:\n\"Archbishop of Victoria, V.I., accompanied by Fathers\nTosi and Robant, camped here and offered the holy sacrifice,\nJuly 30th, 1886.\"\n\"The miners who had traveled with us here divided into\ntwo parties, each party building a raft for itself at the head\nof Linderman Lake, because the timber was not long enough\nto be sawn into planks to make a boat.\n\"The next day Father Tosi and Fuller arrived with the\nother party of miners on a raft. That day we had a sumptuous\nrepast on a duck killed by Fuller. Four days previous it was\nFather Robaut that shot our dinner for us, in the shape of a\npartridge. After some deliberation it was decided that the\nthree miners, with Father Robaut and Fuller, should preceed\non a raft to a place where the size of the timber would justify\nthem in stopping for the construction of the boat They went\ntwelve miles distant, camping on the west shore of Bennett\nLake, and began to saw planks with their whip-saw.\" After\nreferring with numerous interesting illustrations from his\npersonal experience to the plentiful supply of both game and\nfish, the former principally bear and mountain sheep, in the\nregion which they had reached, the Archbishop in his diary\nproceeds:\n\"Without delay we loaded our boats with all our stuff and\nreturned at once, reaching the camp where we had left the two\nminers on Thursday morning. We discharged our cargo and\nth^ miners placed on board of our boat all that part of our\nbaggage which they had been compelled previously to put\nashore and leave in my charge, and as Father Losi had been\nleft alone on so many days, I volunteered\nTO BE A HERMIT\nin my turn; so that the two miners left with Father Tosi,\nFather Robaut and Fuller, leaving me alone to watch\nover our baggage.    The arrangement was that as soon as the 61\nminers had reached their new camping place, the boat would\nundergo a thorough overhauling, and after being made safe\nand watertight should be brought back to my camp to load\nour baggage and to make a definite start down the lakes and\nthe Yukon. During my lonely stay at that camp on the shores\nof Lake Bennett nothing remarkable occured except a visit I\nreceived from four miners who had travelled overland thirteen\ndays from the Salmon River, being nearly starved to death.\nI gave them supper, as many provisions as they needed to\nreach Juneau, and they were very grateful indeed, particularly one who hailed from Ireland and whose name was Harrington. It was nothing but shortness of provisions that\ndi ove them from their camping ground. Their prospects were\ngood, but the water remained too high to allow them much\nwork in the shape of mining. They said they intended to\nreturn next spring a little earlier than they had done this year.\nTo complete my account of my lonely stay at camp No. 3 on\nthe lakes I must say that I availed myself of the absence of\nothers to subject my clothing to washing and repairing. So Saturday, August 14, was a general washing day,\nnot only the altar linen but towels, handkerchiefs, etc., underwent a thorough cleansing. If you had seen my clothes pins\nyou would have been very much amused; some of them burst,\nbut of course my discomfiture was all to myself. Monday,\nAugust 16, was general mending day. I had to remain under\nmy blankets to subject some of my clothes to necessary repairs;\nperfectly safe from any intruders' visit. I hope you will pardon *\nme the minuteness of these private details. They serve at any\nrate to give a complete description of a missionary's life in a\nnew country. The aspect of the country is grand beyond\ndescription. The mountains on either side of the lake are lofty,\nSHAGGY,   RUGGED  AND  STKKP,\n\" They range, I presume, from three to four thousand feet .J\u00a7|||\nabove the level of the sea. Balsam, fir, hemlock, alder, cotton-\nwood and willow are on the slopes of the mountains. I saw\nwild salmon berries, etc., I noticed also some rose bushes, but\nthe flowers were not yet open. Eagles, gulls, ducks, partridges, robins, kingfishers, swallows, some other birds and\nsome singing birds gave a lively appearance to the country,\neven around the lakes. Bears are numerous, so are also\nground squirrel, rabbits and mountain sheep. Father Tosi saw\nan animal like a very large cat standing on the other side of\nthe river connecting Linderman and Bennett lakes, but the\nshouting of some Indians frightened it away.   It is supposed 62\nto be a lynx. Finally, the abundance of fish is literally incredible. To my great joy my lonely stay on the west shore of\nBennett Lake was brought to an end on Thursday, August\n19th, by the return of Father Tosi, Robaut and Fuller in our\nown boat, which was now strong and water-tight and capable\nof carrying us down the Yukon River. We made a definite\nstart the following day, Friday, August 20th, followed by the\ntwo miners in their own boat.\n\"On Saturday evening, we camped at the foot of Bennett\nLake. We reached the foot of Tagish Lake the following\nevening, passed Lake Marsh on Monday and entered the river\nthat connects Lake Marsh with Lake Le Barge about noon\non the same day.\n\"It was on the river between Marsh, or Mud Lake, and\nLake Le Barge that we met the most serious obstacle to navigation in the shape of a succession of rapids about four miles\nlong. These rapids are between two canons\u2014Miles Canon\nand White Horse Canon. Each canon is less than one mile\nlong, and they necessitated, consequently, two portages, the\npacking over which was done by ourselves.\"\nThe Archbishop, after describing the rapids, continues:\u2014\n\"We left camp at the foot of White Horse on the afternoon\nof the same day, killed four ducks and went into camp two\nmiles below the mouth of Takeena River. Next day, August\n27th, we camped at the head of Lake Le Barge, which is\nabout thirty-two miles long, and was crossed by us on Saturday, August 28th. Finally starting again on Monday, which\nwas yesterday, we made sixty-five miles in eight hours, travelling not infrequently at the rate of ten miles an hour. A\nloon brought down by the gun of Fuller gave us last night\nour supper. We are now about to push on northward, and\nare within a few days' navigation from the mouth of the\nStewart River, where we shall decide on selecting our winter\nquarters.\"\nArriving at the Big Salmon (or Ton) River on the 31st\nAugust in the year referred to, the Archbishop said adieu to\nFathers Tosi and Robaut and continued down the river, and\nit is a matter worthy of note that he camped on the present\nsite of Dawson City and celebrated the mass of the Holy\nAngels.\nThe following entries clearly show the growing insanity of\nFuller:\n\"21st October.\u2014Colere de Fuller au dejeuner, m'accuse de\nvouloir le miner. (Anger of Fuller at breakfast; accuses me\nof trying to ruin him.) 1\n63\n12th November.\u2014Fuller m'accuse d'avoir refuse de lui ap-\nprendre le Russe. (Accuses me of refusing to teach him the\nRussian language.)\n\"Sunday, 21st\u2014Fuller me demande pourquoi j'ai envoye un\nde nos Indiens en avant pour bruler le traineau et lui\u2014meme.\n(Fuller asks me why I sent an Indian ahead of him to burn up\nour sleigh and himself, Fuller.)\n\"24th November.\u2014Fuller veut etre tue par moi tout-de-\nsuite    (Fuller wishes me to have him killed at once.\")\nTHE  LAST  ENTRY.\nFuller lui dit que Walker* lui avait predit que je lui donerai\nune mauvaise renommee. (Fuller said that Walker* predicted that I would give him a bad name.\")\nProceeding on his journey the Archbishop at length reached\na point 261 miles from salt water, known as\nMKLOZIKAKAT.\nWinter had now set in, and the whole Yukon land was\nmerged in solemn darkness, and covered deep in a mantle\nof snow and ice.\nOn the fatal morning of November 28th, the Archbishop\nslept on; he had written his last note, but Fuller was astir at\nan early hour (3 a.m.) \"He could not sleep,\" he said. Wild\nhallucinations, intensified by the solitude and the oppressive\nstillness of the place, haunted him; every object seemed to\nhim an enemy.\nPeering into the darkness the Indian guides saw him\nattending to the fire, but nothing happening to awaken their\nsuspicions they drew back to their blankets. All was still as\nthe grave. In a little while they heard Fuller say: \"Bishop,\nit is time to get up,\" and then came the loud report of a rifle\n\u2014the Archbishop fell lifeless on the frozen ground\u2014Fuller\nhad deliberately shot him.\nLittle more remains to be told. The murderer was secured\nby the Indians and carefully watched through the gloom of the\nwinter. Close by, resting on the ice, his rude coffin covered\nwith snow, lay the body of the martyred bishop. And when\nat last spring came round and the bonds of the great river\nbroke, his body was taken to Fort Yukon and then to St.\nMichael's, where it lay until the autumn of the following year.\nA United States gunboat arriving conveyed it to Victoria\nwhere it now lies under the cathedral altar.

E. PHILLIPS,\nGrand Master.\n-Attest :\nFred. Davey,\nGrand Secretary.\nI received with regret a notice from the Deputy Grand\nSire, dated 1st July, 1891, announcing that he had assumed\nthe duties of Grand Sire during the indisposition of the\nGrand Sire. Bro. Busbee having quite recovered from his\nillness was able, on the 4th January last, to resume the duties\nof his high office to the great satisfaction of the Order at\nlarge.\nIn accordance with the following Resolution of the last\nsession of this Grand Lodge :\u2014| That the incoming Grand\nI Master and Grand Secretary submit a question to the Grand\nI Sire for his decision, as to the ruling of the Grand Master 924\n\"at yesterday's Session, on the Amendment proposed by P]\n\"G. M. Waller, to'the Subordinate Lodge Constitution;'3\nthe matter was laid before the Grand Sire to which the following reply has been duly received.\nSovereign Grand Lodge of the I.O.O.F., \\\nOffice of the Grand Sire.\" j\nRaleigh, N. C, May 26th. 1891.\nMr. Jos. E. Phillips,\nGrand Master, I.O.O.F., Victoria, B. C.\nDear Sir and Brother :\u2014Your letter of May 7th\nwould have been sooner answered but for my absence from\ntown.\nYou submit for my opinion the following question :\u2014\n\" A revised Constitution for Subordinate Lodges submitted\nby a Special Committee was under consideration, when it\nwas moved by P. G. M. Waller {vide page 866 of Proceedings) to amend Section 1, Article V, by adding the words\n\\ Lodges may be permitted by a two-thirds vote of the members present to confer the degrees in less than four weeks\nafter initiation:' this motion on being submitted to the vote\nwas declared to be lost. Bro. Waller, P. G. M., then moved\nto amend the same section by striking out the words ' four\nv Cj\nweeks' and inserting \\ twx) weeks ' in lieu thereof. The\nGrand Master ruled this amendment out of order under the\nfollowing Rule of Order of the Grand Lodge (vide page 895\nof the Proceedings). c JN'o more than two amendments to a\nproposition shall be entertained at the same time, that is an\namendment, and an amendment to an amendment, and the\nquestion shall be first taken on the latter.\"\nIn reply I would say that the ruling of the Grand Master was erroneous. The question under consideration was not\neven an amendment to an amendment. One amendment to\nwit* that the section be amended by adding certain words had 925\nbeen submitted to a vote and lost. Thereupon another and\ndistinct amendment was offered to the Section and the Grand\nMaster ruled this amendment out of order. In that I think\nhe committed an error.\nI have answered your question because the matter was\nsubmitted to me by the action of your Grand Lodge. As to\nthe effect of my decision, if it can be called a decision, I say\nnothing.\nFraternally Yours,\nC. M. BUSBEE,\nGrand Sire.\nThe direction of the last Session to prepare and forward\na Memorial to the Sovereign Grand Lodge respecting the\nadmission of members at 18 years of age, was attended to,\nbut I am sorry to say the wishes of this jurisdiction have\nnot been complied with, and this subject still remains unsettled.\nIn regard to the procuring a set of Regalia for Grand\nO X o O\nLodge Officers ordered last Session, I would recommend that\nin view of the great difference in prices that the amount to\nbe expended should be named by this Grand Lodge.\nReceived the following communication from Lt.-Gen'l\nJ. C. Underwood, Past Grand Sire.\nPatriarchs Militant, I. O. O. F.,\nArmy Headquarters.\nChicago, 111, Exchange Building, July 3th, 1891.\nGrand Master Jos. E. Phillips,\nYictoria, British Columbia.\nMy Dear Sir and Brother :\u2014I desire an official\nexpression of your opinion as to the advisability of making\nthe condition for obtaining and holding membership in the 926\nPatriarchs Militant Degree more liberal, by changing the\npresent requirement so as to include \" Scarlet Degree\" members of the Order. Such a change would undoubtedly superinduce a large increase in the membership of the Patriarchs\nMilitant  and work a great advantage to   the   Subordinate\nO CD\nLodge branch of the Order, without injuring the Encampments. The adjunct influence of the Militant Degree is\noften lost, because of the greater expense required to place a\nyoung man not a member of the Order; in a condition to\nobtain it, as compared with similiar requirements of other\nsecret societies. Oblige me with a frank and concise opinion\nat your earliest convenience.\nTruly and Fraternally,\nJNO. C. UNDERWOOD, L, G.\nIn reply I informed him that in my opinion although\nit might prove beneficial to Subordinate Lodges it would injure the Encampment Branch. I advised him instead, to\nenlarge the area of his recruiting grounds by admitting the\nflower of our youth at 18 years of age.\nReceived a communication from the Grand Master of\nWashington, enclosing a claim from the General Relief Committee, of Seattle, on Dominion Lodge, No. 4, Yictoria. for,\n390, nine week's Sick Benefits advanced to Bro. Cowan, a\nmember of said Lodge. Requested and obtained an explanation from | Dominion \\ Lodge, No 4, from which it appears\nthat the Brother did not report himself to the Committee\nduring his sickness, but furnished a medical certificate after\nhis recovery, on the strength of which the Committee paid\nthe benefits, without reference to the Lodge, and on these\ngrounds the Lodge declines to pay. Furnished the Grand\nMaster of Washington with a copy of the statement of Dominion Lodge, since which have received no further communication. 927\nAPPEALS.\nBro. Bredemeyer of Yancouver Lodge, No. 8, appealed\nto me against the action of the above Lodge in refusing to\nCD CD CD\naccept his nomination for the office of Yice Grand, on the\nground of his being elected as Permanent Secretary for one\nyear.\nCalled on Lodge to furnish a statement of facts, copy\nof minutes and statement of Bro. Bredemeyer's services. Having received this information and satisfied myself that the\nbrother was fully eligible and not disqualified by any reason,\nI sustained his appeal, declared the election of Yice. Grand\nnull and void and directed the Lodge to hold a fresh election\nfor that office, and to include the name of Bro. Bredemeyer\namongst the candidates with those in nomination at the previous election. This direction was complied with and the\nLodge now appeals to this Grand Lodge against my action.\nBro. Edmunds appealed against the decision of D. D. G.\nM., District No. 7, in granting dispensation to Tatnai Lodge,\nNo. 9, to elect a third degree member to the office of Noble\nGrand, all qualified members refusing to serve. I sustained\nthe D. D. G. M., Bro. E. T. W. Pearse, power being conferred on him~to do so by Art. 6, Sec. 3, Constitution Subordinate Lodges.\nINSTITUTIONS.\nApril 23d, 1891, commissioned as Special Deputy Grand\nMaster, Bro. W. McCoU, P. G.

G., and Sisters Mrs. Waller and Mrs. Carne,\nI proceeded to Chilliwhack and dedicated a new and h$nd- 928\nsomely furnished hall.    The brethren  of  Excelsior Lodge,\nNo. 7, deserve great credit for their enterprise.\nThe dedicating cermonies being concluded, Bro. H.\nWaller assisted by Bro. Pope, Sister Carne and Sister\nWaller, in a very able manner conferred the Degree of\nRebekah on 19 brothers and sisters\nAfter recess instituted Ruth Rebekah Lodge, No. 4,\nand installed the Officers, and I predict for that Lodge a\ngrand future. Our business over we were banqueted at the\nGrand Hotel, Bro. Webb, D. D. G. M., P. G. Henderson,\nand P. G. Peers, and all the members in Chilliwhack treated;\nus royally, and their kindness will long be remembered.\nNov. 9th, 1891, accompanied by Bros. Waller, P. G. Mo\nMeldram, P. G.

Grand Instructor Sister Bishop, of Colfax\nRebekah Lodge, No. 1, instituted Beulah Rebekah Lodge,\nNo. 5, at New Westminster, which started with a large num-\nber of members. With the assistance of the above named\nBrothers and Sisters the Degree of Rebekah was ably conferred on several applicants.\nNov. 14th, 1891, instituted Acme Lodge, No. 14, at\nYictoria, assisted by Bros. J. E. Phillips, D. G. M., F. Davey,\nG. S., T. C. Gray, G. T., and other members of the Yictoria\nLodges. This Lodge has already a large membership. I think |\ntheir prospects are good to become a strong and prosperous\nLodge.\nDec. 10th, 1891, instituted Cloverdale Lodge, No. 15,\nCloverdale, in company with H. Waller, P. G. M., from\nYictoria, and about 30 brothers from New Westminster, among\nwhom were P. G. Welsh, D. D. G. M., District No. 2; W.\nMcColl, P. G. M., B. W. Shiles, P. G. M., and J. E. PhiUips,\nD, G. M., to whom I feel grateful for assistance. There\nwere five Charter Members, initiated and conferred the 3\nDegrees on 16, making a total membership of 21.    I in- 929\nformed the brothers that their hall was not a proper place to\nhold their meetings, and was informed that they intend to\nhold their meetings in the school house.\nJan. 5th, 1892, commissioned as Special Deputy, Bro.\nHawley, of Selkirk Lodge, No. 12, to institute Kootenay\nLodge, No. 16. ? This Lodge was instituted on the 22nd January, 1892.\nJan. 23rd, instituted Duncan Lodge, No. 17, assisted by\nthat untiring and hard worker, Bro. H. Waller, P. G. M., (to\nwhom I am specially indebted for valuable assistance given\nme during my term of office,) and about 16 other members of\ntlie Yictoria Lodges, also several Brothers from Nanaimo.\nNine Charter Members and 3 initiated. After instituting and\ninstalling the officers we retired to the present N. Grand's,\nBro. Dickie's, where we sat down to a banquet, and a most\nsociable evening was spent.\nThere has been considerable correspondence in regard to\nthe formation of other Lodges in this Province.\nI recommend that this Grand Lodge grant Charters to\nthe above named Lodges.\nINSTALLATIONS.\nJuly 6th, 1891, installed the Officers of Yictoria Lodge,\nNo. 1.\nJuly 8th, 1891, installed the Officers of Columbia Lodge,\nNo. 2.

On our arrival we were\nwaited on by members of the Lodges in that city, who hos-\npitably entertained us. I think that those Excursions are\nmost beneficial to the Order.\nJuly 29th, 1891, to Yancouver Lodge, No. 8, and West-\nern Star Lodge, No. 10 to hold an excursion and appear in\nRegalia, 4th August, 1891.\nSeptember 28th, 1891, to Union Lodge, No. 11, to hold\nAnniversary ball and supper on 16th October, and to wear\nReeralia.\nOctober 29th, 1891. to Selkirk Lodge, No. 12, to hold\nall on 27th November, and wear Regalia.\nNovember 30th, 1891, to Tatnai Lodge, No. 9, to hold\n>all and wear Regalia, on December 4th 931\nJanuary 15th, 1892, to Acme Lodge, No. 14, to confer\"\n3rd Degree on Bro. J. McLennan, in less time than allowed\nby law.   I did this in the absence of the D. D. G. M.\nJanuary 7th, 1892, to Dominion Lodge, Xo. 4, to ballot\nfor and if elected, initiate and confer the 3 Degrees on 12\npersons, applicants for charter, at Duncans.\nSPECIAL PERMISSIONS.\nDec 10th, 1891, received a communication from Ridgley\nLodge, No. 12, Butte, Montana, asking permission to solicit\nCD CD      X\naid in this jurisdiction to liquidate a debt on their property.\nThe merits of the case did not justify me in granting such\npermission. Notwithstanding this refusal, the said lodge did\napply to lodges in this jurisdiction for aid. I thereupon reported their action to the Grand Master of Montana.\nRefused Columbus Lodge, No. 24, Algiers, Louisiana,\npermission to apply to subordinate lodges in this jurisdiction\nfor help to build a hall.\nRefused May Lodge, No. 10, Stark, Florida, permission\nto appeal to lodges in this jurisdiction for aid to rebuild their\nhall, that had been destroyed by fire.\nGranted permission to Lynden Lodge, Wash., No. 71,\nto initiate C. Packard and A. Broe, residents of British Columbia, but residing within 4A miles of Lynden, but 35\nmiles from nearest lodge of this jurisdiction.\nRefused Lynden Lodge, No. 71, Lynden, Washington\npermission to initiate two persons, residents  of British Columbia, since Cloverdale Lodge, No. 15, was instituted ; however, I have asked for further information, and if those persons reside much nearer Lynden, and after getting consent\nt/ CD f  '\nfrom Cloverdale Lodge, 1 would recommend that permission\nbe granted by my successor.\nCD v v\nQUESTIONS.\n1.    It is competent for a Lodge to review and set aside 932\na ballot before the result is announced on the fact being\nbrought to its notice that members had voted who were not\n\u00a9 #\nlegally qualified to do so.\n2. A lodge cannot elect a member to any office who\nhas not received the third degree.\n3. The Noble Grand is the only person authorised to\ncommunicate the A. T. P. W., or in his absence the Yice\nGrand. A Past Grand has no right to receive it from a\nvisiting brother or to communicate it to a member.\n4. The Grand Master has no power to grant a dispensation to hold the installation of officers on the last regular\nmeeting* nip*ht of a term.\no\n5. It is not necessary to ask any P. G. of a lodge to\naccept the office of N. G. before electing a Scarlet Degree\nmember to that office, all qualified brothers having declined\nto serve.\n6. The Grand Master is not empowered to grant dispensations to install officers at special meetings of lodges.\nA number of questions have been submitted which are\nfully covered by the digest or the local law.\nI declined to answer questions submitted by individual\nmembers.\nOn receiving news of the fire at New Westminster,\nwhich destroyed their beautiful hall, involving a great loss to\nthe brethren  of   that city, I immediately telegraphed   the\n\u2022/ ' J CD JT\nlodges, extending to them the sympathy of this Grand Lodge\nin their misfortune. I am pleased to learn that in all probability a much finer building will shortly be erected to replace\nthe one destroyed.\nI cannot close this report without calling the attention\nof this Grand Lodge to the inadequate remuneration paid to\nour Grand Secretary. We are continually increasing in\nlodges and members; this involves a greater amount of work\nfor this officer, and I think the time has arrived when this\nGrand Lodge can afford to pay him sufficiently for his ser- 933\nvices. I take this opportunity to thank Bro. Davey for the\nassistance he has rendered me during the past year.\nAppended are the  reports  of  my   District  Deputies,\nwhich I approve with very few exception s, as noted thereon.\nAllow me in conclusion to again thank you for the high\nhonor you conferred on me one year ago in electing me to\nJ v \u00a9 \u00a9\nthis high and honorable position. I have endeavored to per*\nform the duty attached to the office, to the best of my\nability, and trust that I have given you satisfaction. We\nhave cause for congratulation in the strides our beloved order\n\u00a9\nhas made in the past, the future is full of encouragement;\nmay our hopes in this direction be fully realized. In resigning this trust again to you, and retiring from this Chair, I\ndo so with a. determination to still continue my work for the\nOrder. The year that has gone has increased my love for\nthis Order, and the remembrance of the work I have been\nengaged in and the success that has  attended it, will ever\n\u00a9 \u00a9\nbe cherished as a bright spot in my memory.\nI remain, dear sirs and brothers,\nYours fraternally,\n\u25a0g JOSEPH E.

Robinson, of New Westminster\nLodge, No. 3, submitted the following question for my\ndecision : 936\nI Is it lawful or constitutional for New Westminster\nLodge No. 3, to pay bills without the finance committee having first reported on them.\nMy decision was \" they cannot do so as it would be a\nviolation of Article XII, of their by-laws.\nV\nJuly 2nd, I installed the officers of Royal City Lodge,\nNo. 13.    j 1     |     I \u2022  ;||J:\nJuly 8th, installed the officers of New Westminster]\nLodge, No. 3.\nNovember 12th, granted a dispensation to Royal City\nLodge, No. 13, to confer the three Degrees in one night on\nBros. B. B. Smith, Wm. McDonagh, Wm. Murphy, and Jas.\nMurray, for the purpose of inaugurating Cloverdale Lodge,\nNo. 15. Mi \"I\nDecember  15,  granted  a  dispensation  to   Cloverdale]\nLodge,  No.   15,   to  confer  the  three  Degrees   on several\nbrothers in less time than required by law, as they wished\nassistance and instruction from brothers from New Westminster.\nJanuary 14th, 1892, installed the officers of Royal City\nLodge, No. 13.\nJanuary 22nd, 1892, installed the officers of New Westminster Lodge, No. 3.\nIn all the installation ceremonies during the year I was\nably assisted by P. G. M. Wm. McCoU, P. G. M. B. W.\nShiles and D. G. M. J. E. Phillips, and permit me to say in\nthis connection that the utmost harmony and good feeling\nhas prevailed between the lodges and amongst the brothers,\nand while the increase  in membership has not been large it\nJL O\nhas been substantial, the obiect being   more to get good\n\u2022I \u00a9 DO\nmaterial than to swell the numbers, but on the whole Odd-\nfellowship in this district has moved onward. One new\nlodge having been formed which now numbers about fifty\nmembers, also a Rebekah Degree Lodge now in a flourishing 937\ncondition and increasing membership. But we have also\nhad our seasons of difficulty and trial. The destruction by fire\nof the beautiful hall owned by New Westminster Lodge, No. 3,\nwas a serious inconvenience and draw back to both lodges, for,\nwhile the principal loss was sustained by No. 3, No. 13 was\nseriously crippled for a time by the loss of all her books and\nparaphernalia. No. 3 has also been called to perform the\nlast sad rites for two of its time-honored members, Bro.\nEdwards and Bro. Mcintosh, both respected members of the\nOrder, and held in high esteem by the community at large,\nand whose memories will long be cherished by their brethren.\nRespectfully submitted in F.

District No. 9.\nThe Grand Secretary presented and read his report,\nwhich was, on motion, received and handed to the Committee\non Distribution.\nGrand Secretary's Office,\nYictoria, B. C, 8th February, 1892.\nTo the Grand Lodge of British Columbia, I.O.O.F.,\nDear Sirs and Brothers.\u2014It affords me much pleasure to present you with a report of this office for the year\n1891, and to be able to point to the satisfactory progress the\nOrder has made in this jurisdiction during that period.\nSince we last met four Subordinate Lodges have been\ninstituted, Acme Lodge, No. 14, Yictoria ; Cloverdale Lodge,\nNo. 15, Cloverdale ; Kootenay Lodge, No. 16, Nelson ; and\nDuncan Lodge, No. 17, Duncan. The two latter ha\\ e been\ninstituted since 31st December last, so that their membership is not included in this report.\nI have also received, through Bro. E. T. W. Pearse, D. 945\nD. G. M. District No. 7, the Charter Fee and an application\nfor a Charter for a lodge to be located at Yernon, but as it\nwas not accompanied by the cards of the members, I have\nwritten to the applicants pointing out the requirements of\nthe law and expect shortly to receive the requisite cards.\nFour Rebekah Lodges have also been instituted during\n\u00a9\nthe year : Mizpah Lodge, No. 2, Yancouver ; Miriam Lodge,\nNo.  3,  Nanaimo ;   Ruth Lodge,  No.  4, Chilliwhack ;  and\nBeulah Lodge, No. 5, New Westminster.    I regret I am un-\n\u00a9 j \u00a9\nable to furnish you with information as to  the aggregate\n* \u00a9\u00a9   \u00a9\nmembership, &c, of these lodges, owing to the failure of\nRuth Lodge, No. 4 and Beulah Lodge, No. 5, to forward\ntheir reports.\nI am sorry to again have to complain of the unnecessary\ndelay of some of the Subordinate Lodges in forwarding me\ntheir reports at the proper time, causing me considerable inconvenience in compiling my report. Excelsior Lodge,- No.\n7, sent me its annual Relief Report in an incomplete state so\nthat I had to return it for correction,  but although sufficient\n\u00a9\ntime has elapsed, it has not yet been returned. I am therefore prevented from presenting you with an accurate report\non the matter of Relief, &c, paid.\nBy the institution of the two lodges since 1st January\nlast, and from letters I have received, I feel confident our\nmembership at this date cannot be less than 1,500.\nThe increase of 228 in the membership in the past year,\nhas been contributed to by all the lodges in the jurisdiction\nwith but one exception.\nThe instruction of last session to the Grand Master and\nGrand Secretary to submit a question to the Grand Sire as\nto the ruling of Grand Master Quennell, was complied with,\nthe answer of the Grand Sire will be communicated by the\nGrand Master.\nA memorial was prepared and forwarded to the Sove- 946\nreign Grand Lodge, urging the admission of members at 18\n\u00a9 \u00a9 *     \u00a9   \u00a9\nyears of age, but the desired legislation was not effected.\nThe direction  to procure  a new set of regalia for the\nGrand Lodge Officers, has not been carried out for the reason\n\u00a9\nthat no price was named, nor any appropriation made, and\nas there is so great a disparity in the prices of regalia, your\nofficers would ask that you would stipulate the amount to be\nexpended for this service.\nThe recommendation of the Special Committee on Constitutions, etc., at page 847, Proceedings of last session, have\nbeen complied with, and 1000* copies of the Subordinate\nLodge Constitution, printed in book form, of a size suitable\nto be bound with the by-laws of Subordinate Lodges, and\nj \u00a9\nare now offered for sale at three cents per copy.\nThe Constitution of this Grand Lodge, adopted last session, has been approved by the Sovereign Grand Lodge.\nAt the session of 1884 it was decided to furnish each\nD. D. G. M. with a copy of White's Digest for his official\nuse, and this direction was carried out. At that time there\nwere only three districts, but now there are nine, with an\nimmediate prospect of being further increased to thirteen.\nThe books supplied are now obsolete, to a considerable\nextent, and I have had repeated applications for the new\nedition, besides which there are several Deputies who have\nnever been furnished with one. In view of the expense involved, I submit the matter for instructions.\nOn the 19th July last, Selkirk Lodge, No. 12, forwarded\nall the documents required in appeals, covering the case of\nBrother Brown, vvho had been expelled from membership in\nthat lodge. As no appeal had reached this office, and the\ntime within which the appeal should be lodged, had expired, I returned the documents to the lodge,\nj- \u00a9\nThe finances of the Grand Lodge are in a very satisfac- 947\ntory condition. The receipts of the past year exceeded the\nestimate by $299 50, and the balance in the hands of the\nGrand Treasurer is $246 20 more than was anticipated.\nAITXILIAET  ENDOWMENT   BENEFIT\n| ASSOCIATION.\nThere has been a slight increase in the membership of\nthis association during the year, but it does not keep pace as\nit should with the membership in our lodges.\nThree beneficial members have died, Brother W. H.\nEdwards and Brother S. T. Mackintosh, P. G. of New Westminster Lodge, No. 3, and Brother W. Edmunds, P. G. of\nTatnai Lodge, No. 9. The sum of $206 75 was paid on the\ndeath of Brother Edwards from the reserve fund, and $208 40\non death of Brother Mackintosh, being the amount realized\nfrom Assessment No. 9. Two assessments have been levied\npayable on the 15th instant, to meet the claim on Bro.\nEdmunds' death and to have the necessary amount in hand\nto meet the next call.-\nSince its organization in 1884, this association has paid\n12 death claims, (nine from the Endowment Fund, $1,734 70,\nand three from the Keserve Fund, $638 70), a total of $2,373-\n40.    It has cost the average age member of 40 years, from its\ncommencement, $13 50 for assessments, and $12 for dues, a\ntotal of $25 50 in eight years, or an average of  $3 19 per\nyear, so that it cannot be charged that it is an expensive institution.    The amount it has paid to the beneficiary of the\ndeceased member has in almost every case proved a great\nassistance at a time when every dollar is needed.    If from\nno other motive than benevolence, it claims the support of\nour membership.    I commend it to your most favorable consideration, not only at this meeting, but in your respective-\nLodges. 948\nThe following abstract of the Subordinate Lodge Reports\nshows the position of the Order at the end of 1891, and the\nprogress we have made during the year.\nIncrease.

F.\u2014\nYour Representatives to the Sovereign Grand Lodge\nbeg leave to submit their report, as follows :\nThe sixty-seventh annual session was held at St. Louis,\nMo., on September 21st, 1891, and continued through the\nweek until the 26th. There were present 169 Representatives.\nThe Grand Sire being absent through illness, the Dep- 958\nuty Grand Sire, CI T. Campbell, Past Grand Master of Ontario, presided and filled the office with ability and dignity.\nAfter roll call, and the Grand Marshal had declared all\nthe Representatives duly qualified, the Acting Grand Sire\nread the following dispatch from the Grand Sire, to which\nthe following replies were sent:\nSovereign Grand Lodge of the I. O. O. F\\\nOffice of the Grand Sire.\nRaleigh, N. C, September 17th, 1891.\nDr. Cl. T, Campbell,\nDeputy Grand Sire, I. 0. 0. F.) St. Louis) Mo.\nDear Sir and Brother :\u2014Will yon please convey to\nthe members of the Sovereign Grand Lodge the assurance of\nmy deep regret at my inability to be present at this session.\nIt is to me a grievous disappointment.\nI presume that you have incorporated in your report my\nofficial actions up to the time I was taken ill. I regret that,\nowing to my illness, I have been unable to prepare any report tor myself.\nI pray that the blessings of Almighty God may rest\nupon your deliberations.    And I am,\nYours faithfully and fraternally,\n|        C. M. BUSBEE, Grand Sire.\nRep. Orendorff, of Illinois, moved the following, which\nwas unanimously adopted by a rising vote :\nResolved) That the Sovereign Grand Lodge has learned\n' CD O\nwith feelings of deep regret, of Grand Sire Busbee's affliction by the hand of disease, which prevents his attendance at\nthis session, and desires, at this its first opportunity, to\nexpress its heartfelt sorrow and loving sympathy, together\nwith the earnest hope and prayer that he may be soon\nrestored to health, and the performance of the duties of the\nhigh office which he has adorned by eminent services.\nBro. Underwood, Past Grand Sire, moved the following\no\nwhich was unanimously adopted :\nResolved) That the Grand Secretary be directed to immediately transmit to Grand Sire Busbee a copy of the\nresolution just adopted. 959\nKaleigh, North Carolina, Sept. 21st, 1891.\nTheo. A. Ross,\nGrand Secretary, Sovereign Grand Lodge, I.O.O.I.,\nSt. Louis, Mo.\nPlease express to the Sovereign Grand Lodge my heartfelt appreciation of its,kind and sympathetic resolution.\n^ CM. BUSBEE, Grand Sire.\nYour Representatives would state here, that from a communication recently received from the Grand Secretary, Theo.\nA. Ross, that we are pleased to he able to inform yon that\nour Grand Sire is improving very rapidly, and no doubt will\nbe present at the next communication of the Sovereign\nGrand Lodge.\nThe following are a few extracts from the Acting Grand\nSire's and Secretary's Reports.\nActing Grand Sire on State of the Order :\nI am pleased to be able to announce that the returns\nwhich will be submitted to vou show a most prosperous year.\nDuring 1890, no less than\" 68,295 men were initiated into\nOdd Fellowship under your jurisdiction\u2014the greatest number in any year in our history.    And the net increase for the\nsame period was equally unprecedented, reaching 37,442. On\nDecember 31st, 1890, our male membership in the United\nStates and Canada, and related jurisdictions, was 649,70.5.\nThe returns from Australasia give 19,746, while the German\nEmpire has 2,891, making the total number no less than\n679 339.\nt If onr increase during this year has been at the same\nrate, and we have no reason to doubt it, we may safely assume that our membership on the 1st of September 1891,\nwas not less than 700,000. If to this number be added the\n69 661 Duughters of Rebekah, reported December, 1890,\nwith the probable additions they have received this year,\na moderate estimate will give, at the present date, a grand\ntotal of not less than 775,000. .\nNot only numerically, but financially, the record is\nGratifying. With an aggregate revenue from Lodges and\nEncampments of $7,244,227, we have expended for the purposes A relief through the ordinary channels of the Order,\n\u00a72 917 688 When we add to this the relief expenditure ot\nAustralasia and Germany, together with the payments made\nto widows and orphans by the large number of Relief and\nEndowment Associations, operated in connection with our 960\nsociety, we can place the pecuniary benevolence of Odd Fellowship during the year 1890, at the magnificent sum of\n14,000,000. i     |\nThe following table gives the membership record of all\nforeign iurisdictions:\nJURISDICTION.\nYear introduced.\n4\nOB\n<D\n60\nts\no\n235\n4\n4\n25\n2\n53\n1\n4\n3\n2\n2\n3\n5\n343\n4\nm\nfH\n1\n1\nAustralasia\t\n1867\n1874\n1883\n1878\n1887\n1870\n1888\n1882\n1877\n1872\n1847\n1884\n1871\n19,746\nChile\t\n147\nCuba\t\nQI70\nDenmark\t\n2,051\nFrance\t\n95\nGermany\t\n2,891\nJapan\t\n33\nMexico\t\n125\nNetherlands\t\n97\nPeru\t\n88\nSandwich Islands\t\n163\nSweden ,\t\n72\nSwitzerland\t\n240\n26,121\nExtracts from Grand Secretary's Report:\nRETURNS FOB  THE YEARS  1889  AND 1890.\nGrand Lodges\t\nGrand Encampments   \t\nSubordinate Lodges\t\nSubordinate Encampments.\nRebekah Degree Lodges ...\nLodge initiations\t\nEncampment initiations....\nLodge members\t\nEncampment members\t\nRebekah D.

A Subordinate Lodge cannot legally call a special\nmeeting for the purpose of receiving propositions for membership, and appointing Committee of Character thereon.\n5. In raising and seating a Lodge on the occasion of a\npublic installation, it is not permissible to use the gavel as it\nis used in a regular Lodge meeting.\n7. Under Section 672, Digest (election of members before withdrawal), it is necessary that the Lodge to which a\nbrother applies for membership should notify the Lodge issuing the Visiting Card of his election ; and thereupon the\nbrother must apply for the necessary Withdrawal Card or\nDismissal Certificate; but the Secretary of the Lodge may\napply for such card or certificate, at the instance and by the\nauthority of the brother.\n9. A \" masque ball/' held under the auspices of a\nlodge is not necessarily an affair which may scandalize the\nOrder. It would depend on the character and surroundings\nof the hall. 962\n19, A Patriarch ceasing to be a member of a Subordinate Lodge, may retain membership in his Encampment for\none year, at the end of which period it terminates. Subsequently regaining membership in a Lodge, he can only regain membership in his Encampment by applying for reinstatement therein, and being admitted with all the formali-\nties connected with a reinstatement.\nBy the Grand Sire (Acting).\n3.    A Grand Master or Grand Lodge has no right to\no o\nconfer Past Official Degrees on a brother from another \"juris-\ndiction, at the request of the Lodge of which said brother is\na member; it should only be done at the request of the\nGrand Lodge having \"jurisdiction over the Subordinate in\nwhich the Brother has earned the degrees.\n6. Decision 99, (Journal 1890, p. 11,908), to the effect that <*with the exception of the Officers and Grand Representatives constituting the Sovereign Grand Lodge, no one\ncan obtain the Degree of Rebekah through means other than\no o\nby application to and initiation in, a regularly constituted\nDegree Lodge of the Daughters of Rebekah, (Sees. 1183-4,\nDigest, repealed, Journal, 1891, pp. 177-223), does not*alter\nor conflict with the law in Section 1184, Digest, which allows the degree to be conferred on an applicant without his\nbecoming a member of the Lodge conferring the degree.\nO OOO\nWe submit for your perusal two of the most important\nappeal cases.\nThe first is a question which often arises in the Lodges.\nThe second has never happened in this jurisdiction and we\nhope it never will :\nFirst Appeal\u2014\nTour Committee on Appeals, to whom was referred the\nappeal of G. Rep. Gwinn against the Grand Lodge of Idaho,\nbeg leave to report thereon as follows :\nAt the eighth annual session of the Grand Lodge of\nIdaho, the following question was received and referred to\nthe Judiciary Committee :\n\"The Noble Grand of a Lodge having served eleven\no o 963\nnights of a term and is called away on account of the serious\nillness of his father, being excused by the Lodge from serving the remainder of his term, can he receive the past official\ndegrees ?\"\nCD\nThe Judiciary Committee reported that \" no authority\nis found for such action.53 They cite Section 289 of the Digest, and construe the word \" sickness,\" occurring therein, to\nmean personal sickness, and not that of a parent or friend.\nOn the presentation of this report in the Grand Lodge\nof Idaho, it was resolved that the report be amended so as to\nread \"that the Brother is entitled to the honors of the\noffice.\" From that action of the Grand Lodge, this appeal\nis taken.\nIt is laid down in Section 289 of the Digest, that \u00a7 leave\nof absence for a majority of the nights of his term, works a\nforfeiture of the honors of the term to the officer to whom\nleave is granted;\" and \"unless an officer is present in the\nLodge room, a majority of the meeting nights of his terra\n(unless excused, from sickness), he is not entitled to the\nhonors of his office.\"\nIt seems clear to your committee, that what is meant in\nthat section is that the sickness, by reason of which he is excused, must be that of the officer himself or some providential interposition affecting himself personally, and preventing\nhis attendance, over which he had no control; and that although the Lodge might excuse him  on account of the ill-\no o o\nness of  his father,   such  excuse would not be sufficient to\nentitle the officer to the honors of the office where he did not\nserve a majority of the nights of his term.\u2014Approved.\nSecond Appeal.\nTour Committee on Appeals have carefully considered\nthe appeal of L. N. Billings, P. G., from the action of the\nGrand Lodge of California, and beg to submit the following\nreport: Charges were preferred against Past Grand Billings,\nin Eureka Lodge, No. 4,1. O. O. F., of California, of conduct\nunbecoming an Odd Fellow, specifying that said Billings on\nthe 1st day of March, 1889, in the county of Sacramento and\nState of California, did then and there unlawfully, wilfully,\nand with malice aforethought, kill and murder one Francis\nD. Lightall.    The Brother was tried upon said charge and 964\nexpelled. He appealed to the Grand Lodge of his State, and\nthe action of Eureka Lodge,  No. 4, was there  sustained.\no '\nFrom the action of the Grand Lodge of California, he now\nappeals to this Grand Body. The record is very lengthy,\nembracing all the testimony in the trial below. In his appeal to the State Grand Lodge, the Brother assigned a great\nmany errors and we have carefully considered them.\nThe acquittal of a Brother, on such a charge, in a civil\ncourt, is not of itself a sufficient defence in a trial by the\nLodge.\nIf there was any ground for his objection to the appointment of certain Brothers on the Trial Committee, on\naccount of their bias or prejudice against him, the Grand\nLodge of California certainly cured said wrong by a full in-\no \u2022/ o .    \u2022/\nvestigation of all the facts upon the record, which embraced\nall the testimony taken in the trial below.\nThe specification certainly embraced an offence against\nthe laws of the Order.\nThe Subordinate Lodge certainly had the right to be represented before the Trial Committee by a Brother appointed\nfor that purpose. In the vast amount of testimony submitted, there appears to be considerable conflict, but both the\nSubordinate Lodge and the State Grand Lodge having passed\no m O Ox\nupon the facts, and there being sufficient and ample testimony upon which to found a conviction, your committee\ndoes not feel warranted in disturbing their finding. They\ntherefore submit the following resolution and ask its adoption :\ntilings, from the\no\nResolved) That the appeal of L. N.

G. by said Lodge, on\n29th May last, null and void, and directing a fresh election\nto be held, on the grounds that the Lodge refused to accept\nthe nomination \u00a9f Bro. W. Bredemeyer for this office, he\nbeing duly qualified for the same, and beg to report as\nfollows :\nFrom the documents submitted, the facts of the  case 971\nappear to be, that at the first night of nomination for officers,\non the 15th May last, the name of Bro. W. Bredemeyer was\noffered in nomination for the office of V. G., he being at the\ntime Permanent Secretary, and installed into this office for\ntwelve months ending 31st December last. This nomination\nwas ruled by the acting N. G. out of order, on the ground\nthat the Brother had been installed as Permanent Secretary\nfor twelve months.    At the next meeting Bro.  Bredemeyer\nO J\nappealed against the decision of the Chair in thus ruling his\nnomination out of order, but the Chair was sustained by the\nLodge ; the Brother then gave notice of appeal to the Grand\nLodge, but this was also ruled out as illegal :   he  then  re-\nO     ' CD\nsigned the office of Permanent Secretary, which the Lodge\naccepted from the 30th June ensuing. Bro. Bredemeyer\nthen appeals to the Grand Lodge, and the Grand Master acting on the powers conferred on him by Art. IV, Sec. 1, of\nthe Grand Lodge Constitution, to \" receive and act on all\nI complaints which may be made to him against his deputies\n\"or Lodges,l\\ over-rules the action of the  Lodge,   declares\nO O    7\nthe election for V. G. null and void, and directs the Lodge to\nproceed to the election of a V. G., and to include the name\nof Bro. Bredemeyer as a candidate for that office. This com-\nmand was obeyed by the Lodge, and at an election held on\nv v O     '\n26th June last, Bro. D. Menzies was elected V. G.\nThe grounds of the appeal are :\n1st. | The appeal to the Grand Master was not properly\n| taken, the Lodge not having been furnished with a copy of\n\" the appeal.\"\n2nd. \" The appeal from the decision of the Chair to the\n1 Lodge was not taken till one week after said  decision, was\no \t\n1 given, which is contrary to the law,\u2014see White's   Digest\nI Sec. 1059,1320 and 1622. \"\n3rd. \" The decision of the Grand Master was not in\n\" conformity with the Constitution (see Art. VI. Sec. 6,\nI Constitution of Subordinate Lodges for B. C.,) and laws of 972\n\" the Order, or with general Parliamentary usages, which are\nCD ** ^D>\n\" the basis of our rules of order, (White's Digest 1329, page\n\" 12100 journal of 1890, C. A. Ealler vs. G. L. of Texas.\")\nThe fact that the Brother was fully qualified by previous\nservice for the office of V. G., is not disputed by the Lodge.\nWith respect to the first ground, we cannot find that any\nlaw, organic or local, requires that a copy of the appeal shall\nbe furnished to the Lodge in cases of this character. The Code\nof Procedure laid down in Sec. 5, Art. VII, for appeals arising from Trials where charges have been preferred against\nmembers, provides a form of \" notice of appeals' (form 7,)\nin which the ground of the appeal must be stated in such\ncases, and it appears Bro. Bredemeyer did give such notice\non the 22nd May, 1891, which notice the Lodge declined to\naccept. The Grand Master, also, in his communication to the\nLodge, fully states the ground of the appeal, so that in our\nopinion the Lodge had ample notification, which appears to\nus all the law requires in the premises.\n2nd. The appeal of Bro. Bredemeyer from the decision\nof the acting N. G., on the 15th May, to the Lodge on the\n22nd May, was received'and acted on by the  Lodge on  the\n\u00ab/ J J CD\nlatter date, and the question as to whether that appeal was in\norder, cannot affect the question of his right to appeal to the\nGrand Lodge on the main issue involved. If it was not in\norder, it should not have been entertained by the Lodge at\nthe time it was made, but having then admitted it, and waived\nthe right to challenge it, the Lodge is now debarred from\nraising it as a vital defect.\n3rd. We are of opinion that the decision of the Grand\nMaster was strictly in conformity with law and the usages of\nthe Order.    It is not necessary for a Brother to resign an\nJ o\noffice in order to be nominated to another, \" the law is satisfied if the officer elect is found eligible at the time of induction into office.\" (Sec 999 White's Digest.) It is also the\ninvariable usage to nominate a V. G. to the office of N. G., 973\nwhilst holding the former office without requiring him   to\nresign.\nFrom a review of the whole circumstances of the case,\nwe are of the opinion that Vancouver Lodge, No. 8, acted\nimproperly and illegally in refusing to accept Bro. Bredemey-\ner's nomination as V. G, that the Brother has not forfeited\nhis right of appeal, and that the action of the Grand Master\nwas fully warranted in the premises ; we therefore recommend\nthat the appeal be dismissed and the action of the Grand\nMaster sustained.\nYours fraternally,\nJohn H. Meldram,\nJoshua Holland,\nAngus McKeown,\nCommittee on Appeals.\nJ. Wriglesworth, P. G. M., gave notice that to-morrow\nhe would move to amend Sec. 1 of Art.

Grand Lodye of British Columbia:\nOfficers and Rpekesentatives :\nI feel much pleasure in greeting you on this Our Third\nAnnual Communication, and being assembled in our Legislative capacity to review the past, and legislate for the future\nwelfare of our Order. As the Representatives of the Odd\nFellows in this jurisdiction we meet again in their behalf to\nprotect their interest and to perpetuate a principle to us the\nmost sacred and most beneficial to mankind.\nAnother year has been added to the past. We meet to-day\nunder peculiar circumstances\u2014the proud and the humble\nmeeting on one common footing. We are again gathered\ntogether with one great object in view, that object, the\nteachings of our beloved Order fully explain, and it should\never be our guide. Happy in this knowledge and thankful\nthat he who guides us through life has made us the recepients\nof so many material benefits, therefore let us return thanks to\nthe Father of all good for His benign protection in the past,\nand grant u \u2022\u00bb a continued prosperity in the future. May\nwisdom guide you in your deliberations. May peace and\ngood will guide your every word and action, and when we\nagain part may it be with the knowledge that we have done\nour duty to those we have represented.\nI regret my anticipations to be able to report to you the\nformation of new Lodges has not been succ >ssful, not for the\nwant of energy or lack of assistance of the Brotherhood, but\nfrom the fact that the Province is suffering from great commercial depression and Confederation disappointments, and\nunless a marked change or re-action soon takes place, I am\nalmost certain it will be many years before this jurisdiction\nwill be in a position to claim the right of having a paid Representative to the Grand Lodge of the United States.\nMy report shall be as brief as is consistent with the subjects\nnecessary to present to your notice my official acts during the\npast year.\nThe financial position of the Order and list of membership\nI have no doubt you will receive full and ample particulars from the Grand Secretary.\nOn the 5th of March last I received from the Grand Secretary, letters and correspondence (numbered 1 to 7) between\nAhmeek Lodge, No. 150, of Ishpeming, Michigan, and Black\nDiamond Lodge, No. 5, of this district; copies of which I\nsent to the Grand Lodge of Michigan, calling their attention 68\nto the facts and hardship of the case as regards Black\nDiamond Lodge, and to which as yet I have received no answer. My opinion is, as our late Brother, E. Rodgers, received only that to which he was entitled as a member of the\nOrder, in good standing, and as Ahmeek Lodge, No, 150,\nMichigan, asserts that their funds are depleted, it would be\nonly right that this jurisdiction should come to the relief of\nBlack Diamond Lodge, No, 5, in case they require the same.\nOn the 30th of March, I received from Black Diamond\nLodge, No. 5, a communication respecting some money paid\nover to P. G. Thos. Harris, due the late Brother T. R.\nJohnson, and Brother Harris' reply to same; numbered No.\n8 and 9 referred to Dominion Lodge, No. 4.\nOn the 25th of March I issued a proclamation to\nand every Lodge in this jurisdiction that I had set apart the\n26th day of April, 1876, being the anniversary of our Order\nin America, as a day of thanksgiving, as follows:\nI. O. O. F.\nPROCLAMATION.\neach\nOffice of the M. W. Gband Mastrbof the B. W. Gband Lodge of the Pbo-\nvince of bbitish columbia.\n**in fbiendship, love and tbuth.\"\nSendeth Gees'! ing.\nTo the Noble Grands, Officers and members of the several Lodges in this jurisdiction :\u2014\nWhereas the Fifty-Seventh Anniversary of the establishment of our Order is\nfast approaching, and in recognition of the benevolence and charities it dispenses, the fraternal care it takes of those in need, and of its influence\u2014especially in British Columbia\u2014and in consideration that this is the Centennial\nyear of that great country in which the Independent Order was first established, and in grateful thanks given to the Supreme Ruler for the marked preservation and progress of the Order in this Province; therefore\nI, J. P. Davies, M. W. Grand Master, by virtue of the power in me vested,\ndo hereby enjoin on all Lodges to take immediate action for the proper observance of the 26th day of April, 1876, appearing in regalia as they may elect.\nJ. P. DAVIES,\nGrand Master.\nOn October 5th, I received from Past Grand Master, John\nWeiler, a communication from M. W. Grand Master of R.\nW. Grand Lodge of Ontario, respecting the advisability of\nchanging the name of Grand Lodge of United States to Supreme Lodge of Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and to\ninstruct the Grand Representative to vote for the same in G.\nL. of IT. S.\nOn November 10th, I received from the Grand Secretary,\nJ. L. Ridgley, a communication for this jurisdiction. The\nsame has been laid before the Subordinate Lodges, but I am 69\nsorry to say without those good results which are so proverbial to British Columbia in all cases of charity.\nI regret our Grand Representative did not visit the G. L.\nU. S., when 1 spoke with him on the^subject. Representative Drummond replied, \"if my Lodge wishes me to go to the\nGrand Lodge, U. S., they ought to pay part of my expenses.\"\nIt was impossible to get | definite answer from hira whether\nhe intended to go or not. It is a pity this Grand Lodge was\nnot represented in G. L., U. S. It is to be hoped the Representative will either resign his position or pledge himself\nto meet the G. L., U. S at its next sessions.\nDEGBEE LODGES.\nI would recommend that the Lodges among themselves\nform a Degree Lodge, then all Brothers would receive the\nseveral degrees in a uniform manner, each Lodge paying one\ndollar for each member receiving the same; this fund will\nenable the Degree Lodge to obtain suitable regalia.\nI would also recommend an early formation of Rebecca\nDegree Lodges, as they are touch needed in this jurisdiction.\nOFFICIAL VISITS.\nIn June last visited Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5, Nanaimo,\naccompanied by D. D. G. Master Jeffree, of District No. 1,\nand although not received with that cordiality we had a right to\nexpect, we aided them with our advice and instructions, and\noffered to wait over for the purpose of installing the elected\nofficers, but declined to install them on the night they met as\nit was the last night in the old term, and not the regular\nLodge night.\nIn June last, accompanied by Deputy Grand Master Roberts, paid a fraternal visit to New Westminster Lodge, No. 3,\nand stopped with them for the purpose of instructions.\nAccompanied by the Grand Officers, I have made the following fraternal visits: May 8, Victoria Lodge, No. 1; May\n10, Columbia Lodge, No. 2; May 11, Dominion Lodge, No. 4.\nOn July 3rd, installed into their respective Chairs the\nofficers of Victoria Lodge, No. 1; July 5th, Columbia Lodge,\nNo. 2; July 6th, Dominion Lodge, No. 4.\nOn 3rd January, 1877, accompanied by the Officers of the\nGrand Lodge, I installed the Officers of Columbia Lodge,\nNo. 2; 4th January, Dominion Lodge, No. 4; 8th January,\nVictoria Lodge, No. 1.\nAccompanied by Deputy Grand Master Richard Roberts\nand Worthy Grand Herald Past Grand A. Phillips, on January 12th, 1876, by invitation, we visited New Westminster\nLodge,  No. 3,  for the purpose of installing the officers and 70\ndedicating the new hall. This was a grand day for New\nWestminster Lodge, as the dedication of the new hall and\ninstallation of officers took place in publie, the principal\ncitizens, both ladies and gentlemen, being present. The hall\nand its fittings are a credit to the district and the members\nthereof, and it affords me much pleasure to report on their\nprosperous condition. And I take pleasure in availing myself of the present opportunity to thank the Brotherhood of\nNew Westminster for their kind attention to myself and\nofficers during our official visits.\nDISPENSATIONS.\nIn August three of the Lodges made applications for dispensations to appear in Regalia on the arrival and reception\nof His Excellency the Earl of Dufferin; in accordance with\nthe same I issued the following public notice:\nI. O. O. F.\nOffice of the M. W. Gband Masteb of the E.. W. Gband Lodge of the\nPbovinoe of Bbitish Columbia.\nVictobia, B. C, August 10, 1877.\nAny Lodge of the I. O.O. F. subordinate to the Right Worthy Grand\nLodge of the Province of British Columbia and jurisdictions thereunto belonging desiring so to do, is hereby authorized by this dispensation to appear\nin Public Procession on the day of welcoming His Excellency the Earl of\nDufferin in full Regalia or otherwise, as such Lodge or Lodges may elect.\nGiven under my hand and the Seal of the It. W. Grand Lodge, the day\nand date above written.\nJ. P. DAVIES.\nGrand Master.\nOn December 27, dispensation was granted to New Westminster Lodge, No. 3, to appear in Regalia (by invitation) at\na Masonic Ball at New Westminster.\nD. D. GBAND MASTERS' REPORTS.\nI have much pleasure in laying before you reports from our\nworthy District Deputy Bro. Scott, who sp aks in flattering\nterms of the prosperity of District No. 2:\nIn answer to when is a Brother in arrears, I refer you to your own By-Laws,\nSection 1 of Article 22, Page 40: \" No member who is thirteen weeks in arrears shall be entitled to vote upon any question, neither shall he be entitled\nto receive pecuniary benefits of this Lodge (except he be absent from the\ncitv) in which case he shall be allowed an additional two months'time.\" I am\naware this is a hard question, and to be more, definitely expressed, dues accrue\nweekly. I therefore sustain the appeal of New Westminster Lodge, No. 3, a\nbrother owing \\ hirteen weeks' dues is not entitled to benefits.\nIn answer to 2nd question\u2014The Junior Past Grand is compelled to bring\ncharges against the Noble Grand if he loses the books of the Lodge, but on\nno other charge is it compulsory for him to bring charges.\nI have much pleasure in laying before you the report received \"from D. D. G. Master, Brother Jeffree. 71\nWith respect to the case of Brother John Murray, I have to make a qualified\ndecision.   In the appeal you will notice the accounts stands as follows:\n1876. 1876.\nJanuary 1, to balance   -   -   -   $4 00 June 6, by cash   -   -   -   $6 00\nMarch 31, to dues 3 00 June 26, by cash    -   -   -   4 00\nJune 30,   to dues     -   -   -   -     3 00\nThe last amount of $4 was paid in after the Brother was reported out of\nstanding, he being then sick). On January 1st, $1 of the amount then\nowing is admitted, was two assessments. I have no facts to show that any\nlaw (or custom even) is in force in Victoria f^odge, No. 1, to say what time\nsuch assessments are to be charged as dues; if none, then Brother Murray was\nin good standing. But if on the ot er hand Victoria Lodge by general usage\nor custom have a stated time when assessments are to be charged as dues,\nthen I must confirm the decision of Brother Jeffree. I would call the attention of the Representatives to the G. L. proceedings, vol 2, page 1318, report from the committee on the state of the Order. That the dues to a Lodge\naccrue weekly, and only for the convenience of the Lodge are paid at stated\nperiods; it is therefore at any time the right of a Brother to pay his dues; but\nthe committee are also of opinion that in case a Brother has neglected to pay\nhis dues for such length of time as to be declared by the rules of his own\nSubordinate Lodge from drawing benefits while sick, he cannot be permitted\nwhile he continues sick to come in and pay his dues so as to entitle himself\nto benefits, since any injury would be thereby inflicted on snch members of the Lodge as are regular in payment of their dues; the Brother by his\nown acts has committed wrong, and it would be improper to permit him tjo\nderive benefit from his own negligence.\nWith respect to the decision of Deputy Jeffree on the question of\nfines and assessments (to Columbia Lodge No. 2) as to the proper time when\nthey can be charged as dues against a Brother. Whilst I admit the correctness\nof the quotations of the digest of the G. L. of California, at the same time we\nare now working .under the laws of the S| L. of British Columbia, notwithstanding we have no law in contradiction to this matter, still they are correct,\n(see White digest 165, page 39.) The By-Laws of Columbia Lodge has no\nspecial law on the matter, and as it is admitted that the custom of the Lodge\nhas been to allow 12 months to intervene before they can be charged as dues,\nI must reverse the decision of the Deputy G. M., as custom makes laws, until\nsuch time as proper By-Laws are made bearing on this question. Columbia\nLodge can only charge fines and assessments one year after they are levied.\nI trust this Grand Lodge will make laws bearing on this case at this present\nsessions.\nThe other decisions of Brother Jeffiee are approved.\nFrom District Deputy of No. 3, I have received no report.\nGRAND LODGE, U. S.\nI would call attention of this G. Lodge to the delay in not\nreceiving the yearly reports and proceedings of the G.L., U.S.\nI would recommend that we petition the G. L., U. S., to\nset aside our portion of G. L. assessment for the purpose of\nassisting the Grand Representative to visit the G. L., U. S.\nMISCELLANEOUS.\nIt is my duty to call the several Lodges' attention (through\ntheir Represent tives) to their financial position. Heretofore\nwe have been very successful in getting new members, which\nhas augmented our funds.    We have been fortunate m escaping  the small-pox  that was so lately among us, and\nthe small amount among the Order we do n&t make the\nwith\npro- 72\ngress we should\namong\nShould any epidemic unfortunately come\nus, notwithstanding our apparent prosperity, the\nLodges in two or three months would become bankrupt. We\nreceive per week about 23 cts., and pay to a scarlet member\n$10, As the dues now stand we receive pay for 48 weeks\nonly, and pay out for 52 weeks. I would suggest a committee\nbe appointed to look into the state of the Order in this matter\nand provide a graduating scale of benefits and report thereon.\nI would recommend the formation of a Mutual Life or\nWidow and Orphan Relief Association; each Brother paying\n$1 on the death of a Brother in good standing.    The whoie of\no o\nthe assessment to be paid to the family of the deceased.\nSteps have been taken to bring the Cemetery question before the House of Assembly in a proper shape with, I hope, a\nfavorable result.\nOn August 12th, under the auspices of Dominion Lodge,\nNo. 4, a grand excursion to Albert Head was held. I had\nthe honor of being an invited guest, and noticed among the\nladies a goodly sprinkling of Sisters of Rebecca. The excursion proved a pleasant episode in my official year, and\nhad the effect of re-uniting the families of the Brotherhood.\nI would recommend that the Outside Guardian receive the\nsum of $25 for his attendance at this Grand Lodge Sessions.\nI would also recommend that the travelling expenses of the\nGrand Instructor be paid by this Grand body.\nIn conclusion, I would thank the Brothers for the many\nacts of kindness and courtesy I have received during my\nOfficial term.\nTo Deputy Grand Master Richard Roberts, I am greatly\nindebted for the great assistance he has rendered in District\nNo. 2, more particularly in his official capacity as Grand Instructor. To District Deputies Jeffree and Scott, the thanks\nof the several Districts are due for the very efficient attention\nto their duties.\nI have again to thank the Brothers for their patient attention.    Wishing all a prosperous journey through life, I remain\nTours Fraternally,\nJ. P. DAVIES,\nGrand Master.\nMoved by J. S. Drummond, P. G.

Secretaries are not careful enough; for instance, placing\nmembers who have ceased membership for non-payment of dues, under th\u00a9\nheading of those suspended, thus giving me the trouble of picking them out.\nNew Westminster Lodge, No. 3, in making up the annual report have only\ngiven returns for the half year, and there is not time to send it back for correction. The Secretary seems to have the idea that the semi-annual report,\n.made on 30th June last, is part of the annual one; when, if he had compared the\ntwo forms, they would at a glance have shown that the information required is\nquite distinct. Anotner important omission is the want of the Lodge Seal on\nboth semi-annual and annual returns.\nFrom Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5,1 received papers regarding a claim\nagainst Ahmeek Lodge for relief to a sick Brother, which I handed to the M.\nW. Grand Master; he will, I presume, allude to the same in his report.\nI received several Amendments to By Laws of Victoria and Columbia Lodges,\nwhich I handed to the Committee on Laws of Subordinates, and they will no\ndoubt hand in a report upon the same.\nNo appeals have during the year been sent to this Office, but I understand\nthat Brother W. J. Jeffree, District Deputy Grand Master of District No. 1,\nreceived documents regarding an Appeal from a suspended member, but he\ninformed me verbally he had forwarded the same to the Chairman of the Committee on Appeals.\nI received from the Grand Lodge of Ontario a circular containing instructions in regard to the changing of name of G. L., U.S., and which I attach to\nthis report for any action this Grand Body may think fit to take in the matter.\nIn the month of March last I received a communication from the Grand\nSecretary of the Grand Lodge of F. & A. Masons, regarding the right of burial\nin the Public Cemetery, and I handed the letter to the Committee appointed\nby the Subordinate Lodges who were acting at the time in the matter. I mention the receipt of this letter here for the reason that it came through my\nhands as Grand Secretary of this R. W  Grand Lodge.\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of the proceedings of the different State\nGrand Bodies through the courtesy of the several Secretaries, and I mailed a\ncopy of our last session's proceedings to each in return, as well as to several\nBrothers of the Order, who wrote to me desiring the same,\nI received during the year a mass of correspondence far too large to report\nupon, but I believe I have replied to all requiring a reply, and do not consider it necessary to do more than give a notice of the same in my report,\nthere being nothing to bring before this Grand Body to deliberate upon in the\nsaid correspondence.\nI am pleased to note that from the returns of Lodges, there is an increase of\n33 in membership since last report, and of Lodge receipts an increase of $729 15\nbut as yet no new Lodges have come into existence.\nIn conclusion I have to thank the officers and members of this Grand\nLodge, as well as the Subordinate Lodges for the their uniform kindness and\nassistance given when requied by me, the past year having been one of the\nmost laborious ones I ever had to go through.\nAnnexed are abstracts of reports from Subordinate Lodges to be appended\nto proceedings when printed.\nFraternally submitted,\nJ.

B.C., February 8th, 1877.\nTo the R. W. Grand Lodge,  I.  O    O.  F.,  of the Pbovincb of British\nColumbia:\nYour Committee on Appeals beg to submit the following report:\nBrother E. Fletcher,)\nvs. ?\u25a0        Dominion Lodge No. 4.\nBrother Thos. Harris, P.G.)\nCharges were made against defendant on the 25th of May, 1876, by Brother\nE. Fletcher of that Lodge, accusing him of conduct unbecoming an Odd Fellow, inasmuch as he did receive from Black Diamond Lodge, No. 5, Nanaimo,\nin the year 1874, the sum of $62 50, to be forwarded to San Francisco, California, in payment of the account of T. Rodgers Johnson against the Lodge,\nfor regalia furnished, and you are therefore charged with detaining the money\nfor a period of nearly two years.\n(Signed) E. FLETCHER.\nTo the above charges the defendant pleaded not guilty\nA Committee having been appointed by the Lodge, consisting of P. G. Thos.\nShotbolt, P. G. J. Wriglesworth, P. G. M. J. Goode, P. G. W. D. McKilligan,\nand Hy. Smith, P. G. 77\nAfter a careful hearing they found the defendant guilty of conduct unbecoming an Odd Fellow, on the specified charges.\nThe defendant was afterwards, by vote of the Lodge, suspended for the term\nof five years. He appeals to the Grand Lodge from such judgment; there are\nmany assignments of error, but one of which is deserving of notice: the first\nand second of which respecting the absence of one of the committee, and second the report being signed by an absentee, who had not heard the evidence,\nwas condoned by the action of the defindent's counsel: third, \"the Noble\nGrand to prepare their ballots upon the word expulsion, or suspension must\nbe written.\" This was clearly an error. The N. G. has no right to dictate to\na brother how he\" shall vote on any question; some of the Brethren might\nhave desired to vote against both expulsion and suspension, believing that a\nreprimand, or fine would be ample punishment, and if so they had a perfect\nright to vote as they pleased.\nThe fourth that the penalty is excessive is a question which it is not competent for this Committee to deal with, but is for the Lodge which has the facts\nbefore it\nIt is therefore ordered, the action of the Lodge be reversed, only for the purpose of a new ballott on the question of the extent or nature of punishment to\nbe imposed.\nFurthermore, we cannot separate without calling the attention of this Grand\nLodge that a serious charge is insinuated against some Brother connected with\none of the Lodges in this City by the administrators of the late Brother T.\nRodgers Johnson, and would respectfully suggest that the Grand Secretary of\nthis Grand Body, be instructed to apply to the said administrators for the\nname of said Brother, and the specific charges against the same Brother, as we\nconsider as the question now stands every Brother of this jurisdiction has the\nsuspicion resting upon him of being the delinquent.\nJAMES FE\u201eL, P.

C.\nBrethren   Your Committee on Legislation beg to report that we have no\ni evidence before us that Black  Diamond Lodge, No. 5, B C, acted in accordance with the laws governing Ahmeek Lodge, No. 150, Michigan, for benefits.\nBut from their correspondence on the subject, they have shown a willingness\nto  remunerate Black Diamond Lodge,  No. 5,  for every dollar expended. 82\nTherefore we can only draw our conclusions from their own correspondence\nthat Black Diamond Lodge acted in accordance with the tenor of Ahmeek\nLodge, No. 150, beneficial laws, and would recommend that the Grand Secretary communicate with Ahmeek Lodge and the Grand Master of Michigan in\nregard to the matter, asking a contribution from all the Lodges to assist Ahmeek Lodge in paying her just liabilities; as Black Diamond, No. 5, is as\nlittle able to bear the expense of attending to the brothers of distant Lodges,\nas any other Lodge; besides having from a depleted treasury and subscrip- >\ntions from her members, to pay the just expenses the deceased Brother Rod-\ngers incurred. The Grand Secretary should mention the donation of $52 by\nthe nurse and attendant, leaving a balance of $86 50 due Black Diamond\nLodge.\nYour Legislative Committee would further state that so much of the Grand\nMaster's report as refers to the Degree and Rebecca Lodges is premature, and\nwe are of opinion should be struck from the G. M. report, in consequence of\nthe very limited number of our subordinate Lodges, and the paucity of Brothers' wives to form a successful Rebecca Degree Lodge.\nYours in F. L. and T.,\nJ. S. DRUMMOND,\nB. W. SHILES,\nW. J. JEFFREE,\nT. R. MITCHELL,\nCommittee.\nMoved by Rep. Gowen, of No. 1,  | That the report be -\nadopted.\"\nSeconded by Rep. Elliott, of No. 3, and carried.\nReport read from same committee on dues and benefits.\nVictoria, B.C , 12th February, 1877.\nTo the R.W.G.M., Officers and Members R.W.G.L., B.C.\nBrethren\u2014Your Legislative Committee appointed to report and frame I\nan amendment to Article 4, of the subordinate constitution in relation to fines,\ndues and benefits, for the government of subordinates, whereby the  financial I\nsystem of our Order may be based on sounder principles, we have not yet\ncome to  any definite conclusion in regard to the matter, for the following\nreasons set forth, viz.:\n1st\u2014The Grand Lodge of the United States having had the same  matter\nin consideration for some three years, and awaiting their action on such an\nall important matter, we remained inactive.    The reports only arriving at a\nlate date, we were unable to discuss the subject, but by reference to page 7010 I\nJournal G.L.U.S., we find the substance of a three years' search assisted by\nreports from the different State grand bodies, as to the mortality and per cent-\nage necessary to charge for certain benefits allowed by subordinate Lodges, we\nfind different views on the subject in different localities, referring perhaps to\nthe climate and healthiness of the place.    We would recommend a careful]\nperusal of the report so far as it goes; some jurisd ctions recommending three I\npercent,   dues on the amount of benefits paid out; that would be for our l\nLodges 36 cents per week, While we pay only some 23% cents.    This is the j\nactuaries' report from Virginia; in fact the court of the United States cannot \\\ncome to any just conclusion until they make further enquiries ; their search I\nbeing based on a thirty years' system, and so we ask a continuance of time^/j\nbecause our Lodges are too young to discriminate upon this important subject, and will have to be guided to a great extent by the statistical  report of\nthe Grand Lodge Court at its next session.\nWe have the honor to be yours in F. L. T.,\nJ. S. DRUMMOND,\nW. J. JEFFREE,\nB. W\nSHI^Et\nCommittee 83\nMoved by Rep.

DeCOSMOS moved for a copy\nof all correspondence in 1877 and 1878,\nand not now before Parliament,\nbetween the Imperial, Dominion, and\nBritish Columbia Governments respecting the Canada Pacific Bailway; and\nalso a copy of all correspondence in\n1877 and 1878 between the said \"Governments respecting the Graving-dock\nat Esquimalt. He said that this resolution might have been separated into two parts, but he\nknew of no. good or sufficient reason why the Government should make\nany objection to it as it was drawn.\nThe House would recollect that last\nyear, notwithstanding the fact that the\nGovernor-General had visited British\nColumbia, and notwithstanding the fact\nthat despatches had passed between\nthe Government of British Columbia\nand the Imperial Government\u2014and he\npresumed that despatches had passed\nfrom this Government to the Imperial\nGovernment\u2014they had had no copy\nwhatever of the despatches which had\npassed with regard to the position of\nthe Dominion Government respecting\nthe Canadian Pacific Kailway; that\nwas, so far as the settlement of the difficulty relative to British Columbia was\nconcerned. They had had a despatch,\nhowever, he believed, from the Imperial Government, which had been communicated to the House, and the hon.\nthe Premier had last Session stated that\nthe Government were in possession of\nno despatches, leaving the House to\ninfer that His Excellency the Governor-\nGeneral had taken the business of i ettl-\ning the British Columbia difficulty\napparently out of the hands of his responsible advisers, and had done as he\nthought proper in the matter. In other\nwords, they were to assume that the\ndespatch of His Excellency the Gover- nor-General last year was sent either\nwith or without the consent of his Ministers. Now, there was a point in that\nconnection that might be distJussed.\nIt was not his wish, however, to deal\nwith it at the present moment. All he\nasked for under the first head was\nthat all the despatches between the\nImperial,Dominion andProvincial (British Columbia/Governments should be\nat a very early day placed before the\nHouse, in order that the House might\nintelligently discuss the question of the\nCanadian -Pacific Railway. The next-\npoint would occu'py a little more of the\ntime of the House, and, in order that\nhe might place it intelligently before\nthe House, he craved its indulgence.\nHe asked, in this regard, for a copy of\nall the correspondence that had taken\nplace, in 18?^ and 1878 between\nthe said Governments, respecting\nthe Graving-dock at Esquimalt.\nSome correspondence on this subject could be found in the Sessional Papers of this House, and\nsome in the Sessional Papers of\nthe Province of British Columbia.\nHe would state the case briefly,\nfrom the commencement. The Government of the Dominion, led by the\nright hon. gentleman who now led the\nOpposition, agreed with British Columbia to aid it in the construction of this\ndock. The hon. gentleman who led the\nGovernment of to-day, also confirmed\nthat agreement. The aid was to be\ngiven as a bonus by both Governments.\nThe members of the late Government\nhad agreed that it was to be a bonus;\nand the hon. the leader of the present\nGovernment said he would strictly\ncarry out what the late Government\nhad agreed to perform; but, in that\nrespect ho (Mr. Mackenzie) had not\ndone so. As he (Mr. DeCosmos) understood it, and as the Province of British\nColumbia understood it, the hon. the\nleader of the present Government had\nviolated a plain and distinct bargain;\nHe made this brief statement at present\nwith the view of preparing the House\nfor what he intended to lay before it,\nand then hon. members would be\nable to see how this question stood.\nThe first point to which he would\ndraw the attention of the House was\nthat, in the 1873 Session of the Legislature of British Columbia, he moved\nthe following resolutions:\u2014\n\"Resolved\u2014$hat Article 12 of the Terms of\nUnion between this Province and the\nDominion of Canada provides for the construction of a first-class Graving Dock, in the\nfollowing words : ' The Dominion Government shall guarantee the interest for ten\nyears, from the date of the completion of the\n.works, at the rate of five per centum per\nannum of such sum, not exceeding \u00a3100,000\nsterling, as may be required for the construction of a first-class Graving Dock at\nEsquimalt.'\n\"That the Terms above specified were\nadopted in the full belief that the proposed\nguarantee would be sufficient to _ secure the\nconstruction of the dock by private enterprise.\n\" That although tenders have been publicly\ninvited in England, Canada, and the\nUnited States, yet none have been received\nsince the close of last Session of the Legislature.\n\" That only one tender had been received\nprevious to the close of last Session, and\nthat the Legislature refused to accept.\n\"That, from trustworthy information, it is\ncertain that the guarantee for the construction of the Graving Dock is not sufficient to\ninduce private enterprise to engage in the\nundertaking.\n'\" That it is highly desirable, from a naval\nand mercantile point of view, that the\nGraving Dock should be constructed without\ndelay.\n\"That Article 9 of the Terms of Union\nstates\u2014' That the influence of the Dominion Government will be used to secure the\ncontinue! maintenance of the naval station\nat Esquimalt.'\n\"That the'construction of the dock would\nbe a powerful inducement to Her Majesty's\nGovernment to continue Esquimalt as a\nnaval station ; and that the continuance of\nHer Majesty's ships in the waters of British\nColumbia would contribute most materially\nto preserve peace between the white population and Indians, and by that means save to\nthe Dominion Government large sums\nthat might otherwise be expended in suppressing Indian outbreaks.\n\"That the Graving Dock partakes more of\na National and Federal than of a Provincial\ncharacter. This is especially the case in\nview of the necessity of a first-class dock\nfor the repair of Her Majesty's' ships in\nthe North Pacific, and also in view of\nthe early construction of the Canadian\nPacific Railway, and the consequent development, of an extensive trade carried on in\nsteamships and sailing vessels of the largest\nclass, between China, Japan and Australasia\non the one side, and British Columbia on the\nother.\n| That, as the(true intentand spirit of Sec-\nlion 12 of the Terms of Union was to secure\nbeyond-a doubt the construction of the dock,\nand\u00b0as the guarantee in Section 12 is insuiSP\ncient, this House respectfully recommends\nHis Excellency the LieutenautiGovernor to\nsecure its construction without delay, on one\nof the following conditions \u2022\u2014 ^\n\"1. To increase the guarantee in \u00a3100,000\nsterling from five per centum per annum for\nten years, to \u00a3120,000 sterling at 7\u00a3 per centum per annum for twenty-five years.\n\" 2. In lieu of the present or proposed increased guarantee, the Dominion Government to construct the dock.\n\"3. The Dominion Government to grant to\nthis Province such sum of money in cash, in\nlieu of the guarantee in Section 12 of the\nTerms of Union, as may enable the Provincial\nGovernment to undertake the construction\nof the dock.\"\nThese resolutions were really the basis\nof subsequent negotiations with  the\nlate   and   the   present   Government\nrespecting pecuniary aid for the dock,\nand they were based on Section 12 of\nthe Terms of Union.    Before he proceeded to quote other authorities on the\nsubject, he might state that.the.present\nGovernment   refused    to    give     the\n$250,000 as a bonus  to the Province,\nbut had offered to charge it as a debt\nagainst the Province.   The next point\nwas   that    there   never   were    any\n. communications with  the   Dominion\nGovernment asking it to loan money\nfor the construction ofithedock; but, in\n\u2022evejry ease, after it was found that the\nguarantee of interest to private enterprise was insufficient, the communications with the Government were that\nthey   would   grant    a   certain   sum\nin lieu of the guarantee, or, in other\nwords,    pay   to    the    Province   a\ncertain     sum     in     lieu    of    that\nguarantee.     It   would   be   observed\nthat  those   resolutions   were   passed\nbefore any   communication was had\nwith the late or present Government\nto grant to that Province such sum of\nmoney in cash in lieu of the guarantee.\nIt would be observed, from those statements, that they had no intention to\nask a loan.   In 1873, after the passing\nof those resolutions, he wrote a letter\nto the then Minister of Public Works,\nthe hon. member for Charlevoix (Mr.\nLangevin),   in    which   were   these\nwords:\u2014\n\" The intention of the negotiatiors of the\nTerms of Union, as you doubtless well know,\nwas to secure the construction of a dock-\nfirst class. The guarantee, however, is\ninsufficient, hence I advise you either to\nconstruot the dock at Dominion expense, or\n.pay to us a lump sum of money of not less\nthan $250,000.\"\nThat letter, written to the ex-Minister\nof Public Works, in September, 1873,\nshowed that the question of bouuowing\nmoney, or taking money as an advance\nto be charged against the debt of\nthe Province, never was entertained by\nthe Provincial Government. In the\nautumn of 1873, he came to Ottawa,\nopened negotiations with the late\nGovernment, and, in the afoseneeiof the\nhon. the Minister of Einanee, he carried on negotiations with the hon. the\nmember for Charlevoix, then the\nMinister of Public Works, With respect\nto this dock. When the hon. the\nMinister of Finance returned, it was\narranged that the sum of $250,000\nshould be granted to the Province to\naid in the construction of the Gua\\tiHg\nDock, and that in lieu of the guarantee\nto which they were entitledrunder the\nTerms of Union. He would read for\nthe information of the House a letter\nof the hon. the ex-Finance Mihi&fce?*,\naddressed to himself on that subject:\u2014\n\" Ottawa, Nov. 3,1877.\n\" DeakSib,\u2014With respect to the conversation I had with you respecting the Dominion\naid towards the Graving Dock, and your\napplication to the Minister of Public\n\u25a0Works upon the subject, I have consulted my colleagues, and we are prepared\nto submit to Parliament a formal proposition\nto the following effect: That in lieu of the\ninterest of \u00a3100,000 for ten years, which was\nsecured bv the 12th Section of the Order in\nCouncil dated July 1st, 1871, we propose\nthat advances should be made to you- fnom\ntime to time, upon certificates of the progress of the work, not on the whole to exceed\n\u00a350,000 sterling.\n\"I have, &c,\nI S. L.   TlLLBt.\n\" To Hon. A. DeCosmos,M.P.\"\nIt would be seen from that letter that\nthe Finance Minister of that day\nunderstood that the $250,000 as to\nbe paid to the Province from time to\ntime, asa gift or graiat, and not charged\nagainst the debt of the Province. The\nMinistiy of that day retired, and the\nhon. gentleman who now leads the Government formed the present Administration. As his (Mr. DeOosmos') mission at that time was both to\nthe Dominion and to England\nwith regard to the dock, he .considered it his duty, before going to\nEngland, to obtain the confirmation of\nthe present Government to the'-agree-\nment he had made with the late Government. He found, at the outset, that f\n\\\nthey called in question the nature of\nthe guarantee. He communicated, he\nbelieved, first, semi-officially with the\nhon. the Minister of Marine and Fisheries, and next, he thought, with the\nhon. the Premier, and after the question as to whether the Province was\nbound to pay back any sum of money\nadvanced on that guarantee or nof, it\nwas decided, as the House might fairly\ninfer from the following statement in\nhis report, that the guarantee mentioned in the Terms of Union, could\nnot be made a charge against the Province. In his report, drawn up on\nhis return to British Columbia, dated\n2nd February, 1874, the words were\nas follows:\u2014\n\" As a matter of record, it may here be\np'uted that the nature of the guarantee in\nSection 12 of the Terms of Union respecting\nthe Graving Dock, was considered during\nthe negotiations with Mr. Mackenzie, and\nthat the decision was that the \u00a350,000 sterling in lieu of the guarantee of interest, in\nSection 12 of the Terms of Union, should be\ngiven to the Province as a grant or bonus,\nand was not to be charged as a debt against\nthe Province.\"\nIn order to go to the Imperial Government with a confirmation from the new\nDominion Government, he communicated with the present Premier, and\nhe agreed also to grant the $250,000\nin aid of the Esquimalt Graving-dock.\nThe question of the repayment of this\nmoney, or of charging it against the\ndebt, was not a part of that agreement\nin any shape, way, manner or form;\nand he believed he could conclusively\nshow the House, outside of the letter he\nnow intended to read, that such was\nthe case. He would read the letter\nfrom the Premier to himself:\u2014\nI Ottawa, 14th Nov., 1873.\n\"My Deae Sir,\u2014With reference to the\nproposal you submitted on behalf of the\nGovernment of British Columbia, viz., to\nadvance \u00a350,000 to aid in the construction\nof a Graving Dock at Esquimault, in lieu of\nthe guarantee of interest at five per centum on\n\u00a3100,000 for ten years, provided by the\nTerms of Union, I have to say that any\nchange in the mode of aiding in the construction of this work, from that agreed io,\nwill require the sanction of Parliament.\n\"I can only say, at present, that the Government will sabmit a measure to Parliament\nto carry out your proposal, or some scheme\nequivalent thereto.\n\"I am, &c,\n(Signed),        \"A.

His proposal did not ask for\na loan to assist the construction of the\nGraving Dock. His proposal to the\nGovernment, dated 29th October, 1873,\nstated:\u2014\n\"fi(the Province)proposes therefore to construct the dock if the Dominion Government\nwill pay to the Province the sum of $250,000\nin lieu of the guarantee provided under\nSection twelve of the Terms of Union.\"\nThere was nothing whatever in this\nproposal which authorized the Government to interpret it as an application\nfor a loan. He might go beyond that.\nHere was another proof that in the\nnegotiations, so far as he was concerned, there was no reference whatever to a loan :\u2014\n\" Ottawa, Nov. 11, 187S.\n\" British  Columbia   Representatives j to   the\nHon. A. Mackenzie:\nI Sir,\u2014We fully agree with the proposal of\nthe late Government to ask Parliament to grant\nto British Columbia \u00a350,000 sterling, in lieu of\nthe guarantee under the Terms of Union, for\nthe construction of a first-class Graving Dock\nat Esquimalt, and now have the honour to say\nthat, if the same be submitted by the present\nGovernment to Parliament for its sanction, it\nwill receive our undivided support.\n\"We have, &c,\n(Signed,)   \" A. DeCosmos,\n\" E. Dewdney,\n\"J. S. Thompson,\n\" R. W. W. Oarrall,\n\" H. Nathan,\nI H. Nelson.\"\nThis was an additional authority\nshowing the intention of the agent of\nBritish Columbia to ask for a grant,\nand not for an advance. Sometime\nlater he wrote two letters to the\nMinister of Finance, asking when the\nGovernment would be prepared to\nbring forward a measure in respect to\nthe Graving-dock, and he also had an\ninterview with the Premier on the\nsubject. The latter brought in some\nresolutions on the subject, but, when\nthese resolutions were before the\nHouse, and when the Bill was framed\nhe (Mr. DeCosmos) found there was a\nclause added by which it was proposed\nthat this money should be charged\nagainst the debt of the Province. He\nimmediately remonstrated with the\nhon. the Premier against putting a\nnew face upon the agreement with the\nProvince, or, in other words, for having 8\nviolated the agreement; and at last\nthis c^use was struck out. It might\nbe well for him to read the exact\nwords, so that the House might clearly\nsee what it was. The first part of the\nBill, as introduced, read in this way :\u2014-\n\"1. In lieu of the guarantee of interest at\nthe rate of five per centum per annum for ten\nyears from the completion of the works, on\nsuch sum not exceeding \u00a3100,000 sterling, as\nmay be required for the construction of a first-\nclass Graving Dock at Esquimalt, as pro-'ided\nby the terms of the-Order of the Queen, in\nCouncil for the admission of British Columbia\ninto the Union, advances may be made from\ntime to time, by the Governor in Council, out of\nthe Consolidated Revenue Fund, for the construction of such Graving Dock, upon certificates of the progress of the work; such advances not to exceed, in the whole, $250,000,\nand to be considered as part of the indebtedness\nof the Province in calculating the subsidy payable to it.\"\nAfter making his remonstrance, and\nafter hon. members of British Columbia had also remonstrated against it,\nthe clause: \"And be considered\npart of the indebtedness of the Province in calculating the subsidy payable\nto it,\" was struck out, and the Bill was\nfinally passed. But the hon. the Premier had said to the hon. members for\nBritish Columbia that he was prepared\nto carry out what Mr. Tilley had agreed\nto do. The hon. the Premier stated\nthat Mr. Langton, the Auditor-General,\nhad told him that it was only to be an\nadvance, and not a bonus. He (Mr.\nDeCosmos) denied the correctness of\nMi*. Langton's assertion, and it was\nleft to be settled on the basis\nof what the late Government had\nagreed to do. Finding that the\nhon. the Premier was unwilling to do\nanything in the shape of granting that\nmoney as a bonus to the Province, he\nwrote to the hon.member for Charlevoix\n(Mr. Langevinj, the ex-Minister of\nPublic Works, and also to Governor Til-\nley, of New Brunswick, who was the\nex-Finance Minister, with whom he had\nnegotiated, with the full and firm belief that, if those gentlemen stated the\nfacts to the present Ministry of the\nagreemer t, with respect to the\nGraving-dock, made with the late\nGovernment, no objection whatever\nwould be taken to the payment of this\nmoney from time to time as the dock\nprogressed. He would draw the attention of the House to the reply of Mr.\nTilley:\u2014\n\" Government House,\n\" Frederioton, 28th May, 1874.\n\" Dear Sir,\u2014In reply to your communication of the 23rd inst, I beg to state that the\n\u00a350,000 sterling agreed to be advanced to the\nGovernment of British Columbia towards the\nGraving Dock, was in lien of the facilities secured for that purpose under the Terms of Union.\nI cannot see how there could be any misunderstanding in the matter, as my letter of the 3rd\nNovember, 1873, appears sufficiently definite,\nand the Act just past cites ihe conditions ia\nthe fir3t section\n\" I have the honour to be, dear Sir,\n\"Yours faithfully,\n\"S.

Thought my letter explicit.\n(Signed,) 18. L. Tilley.\nI To Hon. A. DeCosmos.\"\nThis settled the point that so far as the\naction of the late Government, through\nthe ex-Finance Minister,was concerned,\nthe intention was that this $250,000\nshould be paid to the Province as a gift,\nand was not to be charged against the\ndebt of the Province. The next letter\nhe would read,confirming this position,\nwas a letter addressed to himself by\nthe hon. the ex-Minister of Public\nWorks\u2014the member who was now on\nthe floor of this House, the hon.\nmember for Charlevoix :\u2014\n| Quebec, 1st June, 1874.\n\" My Dear Mr. DeCosmos,\u2014Your letter\nof the 29th of May has just reached me. In\nanswer, I have no hesitation to say that the\nGovernment to which I belonged promised to\ngrant to British Columbia, ae a \"bonus, the\nsum of \u00a350,000 sterling in lieu of the guarantee contained in the 12th Section of the Terms f\nof Union. We were convjja^ed that British\nOoJiypbia could not build their Graving Dock\nwith that guarantee ; and inasmuch as the\nintention of both parties to the Terms of\nIjnion was to secure that Graving Dock, we\nthought it but just, to replace it by such\na sum as would secure it to your Province, British Columbia and Great Britain\ncontributing their share, or British Columbia\nsupplementing the balance. Of course this\nsum of \u00a350,000 sterling was not to be an advance of money, but a bonus in place of the\nguarantee. We knew we would have to ob-\nI ain the sanction of Parliament to such an\narrangement, and we told you we would do\nso. I am very positive about these negotiations, inasmuch as I was conducting them,\nchieflv, previous to the return of Mr. Tilley\nfrom England. I hope the above will prove\nsatisfactory, and remain, my dear Mr.\nDeCosmos,\n\" Yours very truly,\n| Hector L. Lansevin.\n1 Hon. A. DeCosmos, M. P.\"\nIf further proof were wanting, he be-\nlioved that it could be had ; but here,on\ntlio evidence of two witnesses, he\nthought he had established conclusively\nthat the agreement of the late Government was to pay $250,000 to the Province of British Columbia to aid in the\nconstruction of the Graving-dock. The\nhon. the Premier having agreed, in the\npresence of the members of British\nColumbia, that he would do what Mr.\nTilley had agreed to do, afterwards\nviolated that agreement by refusing to\npay the money over to the Province\nto enable it to construct the clock.\nFive years, nearly, had elapsed since\nthese negotiations were entered into,\nand had the Government kept faith\nwith the Province, the dock, instead of\nbeing only started\u2014a mere coffer-dam\nonly being now in the course of construction\u2014would have been completed,\nand Her Majesty's ships of war might\nhave been docked there. It might have\nbeen used as a implement of defence\nin case of war between the Imperial\nGovernment and Russia or any other\ncountry, and as a nucleus for a colony\nof ship-builders. The money expended\nwould have given employment to a\nconsiderable number of men, and thereby increased the revenue derivable\nfrpm Cu.ato.ms and Excjse by this Dominion ; bat, as it was,this groat.work,\n,one of the Terms of the Union, was\nnow practically in abeyance. In going\na step further, he wisbed to direct tfte\nattention of the House to a report of the\nCommittee of the hon. the Privy Council of 29th May,1876, in whichtheMin-\nister of Finance was credited with using\nthe following language :\u2014\n\" The hon. the Minister of Finance, under\nthese circumstanqej3,advises that the Government of British Columbia be informed that,\nin the opinion of this Government, the first\nsection of Chapter 17, 37 Victoria, only contemplates an advance of certain moneys, and\nthat it is not in the power of the Government\nof the Dominion to make a gift of the sum of\n$250,0C0, as would appear, from the preceding telegram, to be expected by the Government of British Columbia.\"\nFrom this, they found that,in 1876, the\nGovernment having in its possession\nundoubted evidence of the agreement\nwith the late Government, for he sent\nthe letters he received from the hon.\nmember for Charlevoix, and the present Governor of New Brunswick, to\nthe Government, and copies were taken\nof them\u2014interpreted the first section\nof Chapter 17, Victoria 37, to mean\nmerely an advance (and not a bonus to\nthe Province; again, showing that\nthe hon. the Premier\u2014instead of Cftrny;-\ning out his deliberate agreement nyi^e\non the floor of the House with the hfift.\nmembers for British Columbia, when\nthe Bill was passed\u2014again concurred\nin violating the agreement between\nBritish Columbia and 1hc Dominion.\nHe had further evidence in his possession as to the views entertained by\nthe Government, with respect to that\nsum of money. He intended to show\nwhat the opinion of the leader of the\nGovernment was with respect to the\nDock in February, 1874, before any\ndifficulty had arisen between the Government of British Columbia and the\nDominion with respect to the construction of the railway. Ho would\nread to the House a telegram received\nfrom the hon. the Minister of Public\nWorks, to whom he had sent a telegram, asking hi m to telegraph :%.Q$py of\nthe ox Finance Minister Tilley's letter\nto him (Mr. DeCosmos) respecting the\ndock, which had been mislaid here at\nOttawa, in the hon. gentleman!s office\nhe believed, before bis return to British\nColumbia. To that telegram he received the following answer from the\nMinister of Public Works:\u2014\n\" Ottawa 6th, Feb., 18.74,\n\" Your telegram went astray.   Government\noffer is to pay ($26,000) two hundred ajid fifty thousand dollar^, as dock work progresses in\nlifett<6f guarantee provided by Terms of Union.\n(Signed) \" A. Mackenzie.\"\nThat was final and conclusive evidence\nas to the understanding existing between the Province of British Columbia\nand the Dominion on the 6th February,\n1874. Having explained this matter^\nand given to the House a brief narrative of the negotiations respecting the-\nGraving Dock, he considered he had\ncHSiJharged his duty, alike to his con-\niSattients, to the Province of British\nColumbia and to the Dominion. He\ntrusted the hon. the leader of the Government would find occasion to make\nreparation to the Province of British\nColumbia for the great wrong he had\ncommitted in not carrying out the\nagreement made with it in November,\n1^7'L He trusted also the Government\nwould consent to bring down the\np'SJJiCrs called for in this motion.\n.Mr. BUNSTER said ho felt it a duty\nincumbent upon him to second the\nmotion, inasmuch as His Excellency\nthe Governor-General, when he visited\nBritish Columbia, promised faithfully,\nand he supposed His Excellency had\nthe ear of the Government when he\nmade that statement, that railway construction should be commenced, according to the terms of the Carnarvon\naward. This promise, he might add,\nhad been made in his own presence. The\nterms of the treaty under which British\nColumbia had entered the Dominion\nhad not been carried out in that spirit\nof fair play which would be expected\nfrom British statesmen. However,\nthanks to one of the great natural\nresources of the Pacific Province, which\nwas being rapidly developed and\nworked, a change had taken place\nin the prospects of British Columbia, and the people there did\nnot care so much as formerly\nwhether British statesmen carried out\ntheir promises or not, as the future of\nthat great country was now assured.\nThrough their faith in the Dominion,\nBritish Columbia had lost a railroad,\nthat would, under similar circumstances, have been built years ago\nby their American neighbours'. The\npeople of British Columbia would have\nhad a railway running- past their doors\nwere it not for the way the Canadian\nPacific Railway bad been villified by\none party and ignored by the other, it\nwas the first time in history that anything had been said against British enterprise ; but it was owing to the failure\nof British enterprise that to-day they\nwere without a road. If British Columbia had not entered the Confederacy of\nCanada, they would have been in a position to make treatios with the Americans to bring their railroads to British\nColumbia, which had been fully their'\nintention. It was well known the\nAmericans wished to get hold of British\nColumbia; but, having much British1\nblood in their veins, tbe people of\nBritish Columbia preferred to ally\nthemselves to Canada and stand by the\nold flag. Had Canada been true to\nher promises ? He could only reply\nno. Three hundred British citizens\nhad been' swept away in a moment\nthrough the wreck of a tub of a steamboat, indirectly occasioned by the\nwant of a railroad, for, if the American\nrailroad had been built, there would\nhave been no necessity for a steamboat, and they would not have had\nwidows and orphans left on their\nhands. The loss of that vessel and so\nmany lives was one which could not\nbo compensated by the building of the\nCanadian Pacific BailrOad, which was\na mere myth in comparison. All that\nwas required to build the Pacific\nRailroad was brains and intelligence.\nThe increase in the value of the public\ndomain would more then cover the\ncost of building the road. The Government was too oautious, too much\nafraid of going into debt. That was a\nmistake. English capitalists loaned\nmoney to the South AmericanRepublics\nfor railroad speculation in the United\nStates, and never got a cent in\nreturn, eithe/ in capital or interest.\nWe had a good country; there was\nplenty of money in England to buy\nthe'steel rails, and sufficient labour to\nbuild the road, and all that was required was pluck, enterprise, and\nenergy on the part of the Canadian\nGovernment to go on with the road.\nThe population would follow. They had\nhad a good example already in some\nof the Western States of the American\nUnion, where the people were now;\nbringing water to fertilize their lands\nfrom thirty to forty miles distance, at\nan expense of millions of dollars, and yet 8\nwere well repaid for their labour and\nexpenditure. And they were sending\ntheir cereals to Europe from that heretofore barren desert. Canadians would\nnot awake t\u00a9 the advantages they had\nover and above the Americans, among\nthem being two days and nine hours\ngain in time from China to Liverpool\nby the Canadian route. They would\nnot awake to the importance of\nthe country. He declared without\nfear of contradiction, that they had\nallowed their neighbours to get ahead\nof them and they (the Americans)\nknew it and boasted of it. Had\nthe Dominion developed its own\nresources, they would not to-day see\nfive hundred thousand Canadians\nseeking employment in another\ncountry, when their own country owned\na better domain. In connection with\nthat question, some members had seen\nfit to state that the members from\nBritish Columbia had tried to monopolize the time of the House. That\nhe denied emphatically. He thought\nthe spirit of the members from\nBritish Columbia had been to utilize\nthe time of the House in the interests\nof the Dominion at large, to show the\nresources of the country, and no one\ncould fail to acknowledge that British\nColumbia, with her great and enduring\nresources, was anything less than a\njowel of great price to Canada and the\nEmpire. She possessed greater and\nmore valuable resources than the whole\nof the Dominion combined, whether\nthey considered her lumber, coal,\nagricultural or mineral resources, her\nseas teeming with fish, her numerous\nharbours or her general climate.\nMr. KIRKPATRICK: And her\nmembers.\nMr. PUNSTER said her members\nwould compare favourably with the\nmembers of any Parliament. Her\nmembers came here to demand the\nrights granted to British Columbia\nunder treaty, which remained unfulfilled. If they were pertinacious on\nthat point, it was through a sense of\nduty, feeling that the treaty with\nBritish Columbia had not been carried\nout according to the spirit or letter of\nthe law, a fact which had grieved the\npeople much. There were many members and others in British Columbia\nwho could argue the case better than\nthe representatives in this House,\nespecially himself. When they had\nentered into a solemn treaty, and\nsacrificed thereby their j own interests\u2014sacrificed railroads offered them\nby other countries, the privilege\nof making treaties with other countries,\n\u2014they certainly had a right to\nask of the Dominion Government\nthat it should carry out a portion of\nthe treaty, at least when the Government had sent steel rails to their shores\nand piled them up, and then said they\nwere not going to utilize them in the line\nof railroad for which those rails were\nintended; when they had reserved lands\nand thereby excluded immigration to\nthese lands; when emigrants, as good\nBritishers as ever landed in Canada,\nwere obliged to go to other shores to\nseek a home,\u2014the people of British\nColumbia had a right to feel aggrieved.\nThe Dominion had not built the road,\nand the rails were still lying unused,\ndeteriorating in value more than if\nlaid down on the line. The Government lands would have paid four times\nover the expense of building the road\neven according to the prices obtained\nfor the lands at public auction. Emigrants could.not settle on tho lands reserved by the Dominion Government,\nunder contract; and yet the hon. the\nPremier did not acknowledge the contract. Nevertheless, the contract existed. Emigrants who had been induced to come to the shores of British\nColumbia had been obliged to emigrate\nagain to Washington Territory, Oregon,\nand elsewhere, owing to not being\nallowed to settle on those reserved\nlands. Every fair-minded person couid\nnot but acknowledge that it was a deplorable state of affairs. The Government should take hold of this national\nhighway, and by it unite Canada from\ncoast to coast. He was satisfied the\nGovernment could carry it out, if they\nwould only try, and, if they did not,\nhe could only repeat what he had\nstated on other occasions, that some\nelse would.\nMotion agreed to.\nALASKA BOUNDARY LINE.\nMOTION FOR REPORT.\nMr. DeCOSMOS moved for a cppy\nof  the   report,   with  accompanying 9\nmap, of the engineer who was employed last year in determining the\nprobable boundary line between British\nColumbia and Alaska, and also a\ncopy of his instructions., with a copy of\nthe treaty or convention between (J real\nBritain and Russia respecting the said\nboundary. He said he considered that\nthis information ought to be placed in\nthe Sessional Papers, to give every\nhon. member of this House a clear idea\nof our relations with the United States,\nso far as the boundary line of Alaska\nwas concerned. It was necessary that\nthis boundary should be defined, to\nprevent a conflict in the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the two countries.\nThere was at this moment a great excitement in British Columbia with respect to mining, and valuable quartz\nlodes had been found on the Alaska\nside of the boundary. If, at any time\nhereafter, quartz lodes were found\nnear the supposed boundary, it might\ncreate more or less excitement of an\nunpleasant character between the two\ncountries. It was necessary that, in\nconnection with the boundary, on the\nStickeen River more particularly, an\narrangement should be made between\nthe two Governments to determine a certain point as the\niimit of their respective jurisdictions. He was assured that at\nthe American town of Wrangel, situated\nopposite the mouth of the Stickeen\nRiver in Alaska, sales were made to\nmen employed on the British side of\nthe Stickeen during the year, to the\namount, in round numbers, of $100,000\nworth vof merchandize. When be\ndrew the attention of the Government,\nand especially of the hon. the Minister\nof Customs, the other day, to the duties\npaid at Stickeen, it was with the view\nof ascertaining whether some evidence\ncould be obtained to corroborate the\nstatement made to him by steamboat\ncaptains as to the trade on the Stickeen.\nBy the non-definition of the boundary,\neven temporarily, by the two Governments, this trade was thrown into\nAmerican hands instead of into British\nColumbia hands. He was assured that,\nif the boundary proposed by Mr.\nHunter who was sent there by the\nGovernment last year, were adopted,\nand a Customhouse station placed\nthere,   Canadian    steamships   would\nI proceed there, and the miners who\nvisited them during the winter season,\nwould make their headquarters on the\nBritish side of the line. As the matter\nwas now, they were really contributing\nto build up the American side and to\nthe support of American steamers\npassing from Portland to Alaska and\ncarrying Oregon produce, instead of\nBritish steamers which might pass\nthrough the mouth of the Stickeen\ninto British Columbian territory. He\nhoped the Government would bring\ndown Mr. Hunter's report and maps,\nand any additional information, which\nwould show the outline of Alaska in\nfront of British territory, the inland\nincluded.\nMr. BUNSTER, in rising to second\nthis motion, said it would have afforded\nhim much greater pleasure if the motion had been for the purchase of\nAlaska. Hon. gentlemen might laugh,\nbut looking at the matter from a national point of view, he fully meant\nwhat he said, from his knowledge of\nthe country, that the territory of\nAlaska possessed a more genial clime\nthan Ottawa, notwithstanding its latitude, while its natural resources and\ncapabilities were more valuable than\npeople had any idea of. As early as the\nmonths of January and February, gardening operations were commenced. He\nquestioned very much if they could do\nthat in Ottawa. Vegetation was rapid\nduring the summer season, but he\nmust acknowledge not so rapid as here\nat the Capital. When hon. members\nof this House sneered at Alaska, he\nhad a right to speak from his own personal knowledge, and tell them they\nwere mistaken ; and the day was not\nfar distant when, from the geographi-\ncalposition of this country, they would\nsee the force of his remarks on this\nsubject. They could not but recognize\nthe great fact, that British Columbia\nwas the centre of the British Empire,\nbetween Australasia, luvrope and Canada. Hence, he felt that that Province occupied a proud position ; and\nthat it was the duty of every British\nColumbian to keep his fellow countey-\nmen here well informed on British\nColumbia. He remembei'ed when Spr\nJohn A. Macdonald brought British\nColumbia into the Union, much to her\ndetriment,    because     the    contract r\n10\nwas   hot   earrieo   out.   that    it   was\nconsidered a foohVh bargain; but to-day\nthe   Americans   felt   proud   of   thcii\nAlaska   bargain.    Seven   millions   in\ncash were paid for that, but not a dollar was paid for British Columbia. Let\nthe House contrast the difference, and\nsee wbat a mistake Cunada made during the Crimean war,  in  not  laying\nhold  of that  country.    The  lease of\nAlaska was more than enough to pay\none    million    dollars   annually.      It\nwas  the  best investment the United\nStates had ever made.\nMr.. MACKENZIE:   Mr.  Speaker,\nthis question raised by the hon. gentleman  behind  me,  is one of a great\ndeal of importance.    I would suggest\nto him that he make his motion a little\nwider.    The motion, as it  is  framed,\nsimply' calls for the report of Mr. Hunter, a civil engineer sent on an exploratory survey, to determine, as far as his\nintelligence and information enabled\nhim to do so, the  true  boundary line\naccording to  the Russian Convention\nof 1825 ; but we have had a good deal\nof correspondence  on  this  subject, of\nan official character, with the  United\nStates Government, and some questions\narose in connection with  the  navigation  of the Stickeen River, which is\naffected to some extent  by the Treaty\nof Washington.    I think it is desirable\nthat the hon. gentleman  should widen\nhis motion in this  sense, adding the\nfollowing   words:   \" And   also   such\nother papers as relate to the defining-\nMacLean Roger & Co.\nof the boundary line between Alaska\nand British territory, and the navigation of the rivers passing from British\nColumbia through Alaska to the sea.''\nWe will thus Ije able to place a collection of  paport in  consecutive order,\nwhich will show the position in which\nth;s matter stands at'the present time. I\nmay say that we  have made every,\neffort vto get a settlement of this ques-\nsion, and took the necessary means to\ndo so; but there seems to be some difficulty    on   the   part   of  the   United\nStates in( obtaining an 'appropriation\nfrom   Congress   sufficient   to   accomplish the purpose desired. ' We then\nendeavoured to obtain a definition of the\nboundary at points of common interest^-\nsuch as the crossing of the Stickeen\nRiver; and this we failed in  accomplishing  in  consequence of the difficulty    experienced,     apparently,    in\nWashington, in obtaining moftey from\nCongress to devote to this object.

As regards the channels. and approaches of the three named respectively\nTelegraph, Middle, and North Channels, Telegrapfi Channel is available at high\nwater for ships drawing 25 feet up to Port Essington, the deepest water being on\nthe mainland side, abreast of Kennedy Island, and on the Island side abreast of De\nHorsey Island (as will be seen by the plan annexed), heavy tide rips occur at springs.\nThe passage between Kennedv and De Horsey Islands I have designated as the\n\"Middle: \" it is between sand banks, which, L should think, are liable to shift at\ndifferent seasons of the year, and is only fit for small steamers. North Channel (or\nNorth Skeena Passage), has a passage for steamers of light draught, and is entered\nover a flat with about three fathoms low water springs, and has an outlet between De\nHorsey Island and the mainland of only half a cable in width, at low water the ebb\ntide setting strongly through it. I do not recommend it for large vessels. Port\nEssington should therefore be reached from the westward, either by the Browning\nEntrance, Ogden Channel and Cardina Bay, or by Dixon Entrance, Chatham Sound,\nArthur Channel and Cardina Bay.\n2. Anchorages.\u2014Skeena River has an extensive anchorage ground between Port\nEssington and the north end of De Horsey Island; holding ground is good, being soft\nmud; at springs heavy tide rips occur, making boat or lighter work dangerous.    Er, \nCunningham (a trader of many years experience at Port Essington) informed me\nthat the river was never frozen at Port Essington, but great quantities of ice come\ndown in the spring, as well as immense trees. During the winter months heavy\ngales from the north are frequent, and, I should think, would completely suspend\ncommunication between the shore and vessels in the stream, as there is no shelter\nfrom their full force.    High water approximate 1-0-0, F. & C. rise 24 feet springs.\nis  limited in  extent (plan\nand is free from tide rips,\nf aTMMYirra ' holding ground is\nM feet\nWoodcock's landing affords a fair anchorage but\nsprings\nap-\nannexed), it is more sheltered than Port Essington\nalthough the ebb tide runs between four and five knots at springs;\ngood,   oeing mud off the   village, II.  W.  i\\ & C, 12.15,  rise\nproximate neaps IT feet (vessels must moor).\nCardena Bay is the best anchorage in the vicinity, being sheltered from N\". and\nS. E, 5 holding ground is good; tide sets fairly through the anchorage; H. W. P.\nand C, noon springs rise 24 feet; neaps, 1*7 feet approximate.\nThe prevailing winds in the vicinity of the Skeena are said to be westerly during\nthe summer months, and during the remainder of-the year S.E. and WSM with\nheavy gales occasionally from the north. Fogs are frequent in August and September. Eain is prevalent in spring and autumn, and during the stay of the u Daring,\"\nfrom 1st to 27th September, the prevailing winds were easterly and south-easterly,\nwith almost constant rain and frequent squalls; during the same time the barometer's\nlowest was 28\u00b0 90'; highest, 30\u00b0 30'.\nThe land about the entrance of the Skeena is mountainous and densely wooded\n(chiefly cedar and hemlock) and shows signs of a remarkably wet climate, and, I\nShould say, is quite unfit for settlement,\nI have, &c,\nJ.

With a view to forming an opinion on this subject I have carefully perused the\nreports   of exploration   of 1874 and 1877, made by   Mr.   Sandford  Fleming the\nBngineer-in-Chief, and I have had tl\nig advantage\nof personal interviews with :Mi\\ Marcus Smith, Mr. Cambie and other Engineers of the Survey. An ascent of\nthe Prazer River, as far as Yale, and on to Boston Bar by land, has enabled me to\nform some idea of the difficulty of penetrating the cascade range of mountains with\na line of railway. I have further inspected Burrard Inlet, Haro and Georgia Straiis\n(as well as the inner channels emerging at Active Pass), Discovery Passage and some\nof the channels in the vicinity of Valdes Island, including Seymour Narrows. An\nexamination has also been made by their Lordships' direction of the approach^.; \u2022\u2022>\nthe Skeena Eiver, the result of which has been reported in my letter ZSTo.' 326 of ihj\nOth instant.\n3. The question of site of ocean terminus should,\nmined  by two main\nappears\nto me, be deter-\nengineering point of\nconsiderations (besides feasibility in ah\nview):\u2014\n1st. Its suitability for the interests and traffic of the populated parts of British\nColumbia, that Province having joined the Dominion upon the promise of a railway.\n2nd. Its being situated at a convenient port for ocean steamers to take up,\ndirect from wharf accommodation, the through traffic for Australia, China, Japan,\nand other places across the Pacific at all seasons of the year and in all weathers.\n4. Bearing in mind these considerations, it appears desirable to reject all idea of a\nterminus on the coast between Vancouver and Queen Charlotte Islands. The navigation of that part of the coast, judging from the charts and from the reports of\nAdmiral Richards and other naval officers, is decidedly unfavorable, and I should\nequally reject the vicinity of the Eiver Skeena owing to the prevalence of fog, ice\nand other climatic causes incident to a high.latitude, as well as to the difficulties of\napproach from sea.\n5. If the above views are correct, the question of site for the terminus is narrowed\nto a choice between Burrard Inlet and a port in Vancouvers Island.\n6. Burrard Inlet does not appear suitable for an ocean terminus^ on account of\ndifficulties of navigation to seaward. The tortuous channel from Burrard Inlet to\nsea through Haro Strait will frequently be unsafe on account of the strength of the\ntide, great prevalence of fog and absence of anchoring depth. Burrard Inlet itself\nalso, although possessing a safe port in Cole Harbour, and a good anchorage in English\nBay, has these objections, viz.: that the narrow entrance to Cole Harbour through the\nFirst Narrows is hardly safe for large steamers in consequence of 1he rapidity of the\ntide; and that English Bay, although affording good anchoi age, would not, in my\nopinion, be smooth enough during north-westerly gales for ships to lie at wharves,\nthere being a drift of forty miles to the north-west.\nf7. Another grave objection to Burrard Inlet as the final terminus, is the possession\nof San Juan and Stuart Islands by a foreign power. These islands torm the key of the\nnavigation inside Vancouver Island. Incase of war with the United States that\npower might readily stop our trade through Haro Strait. (San Juan was visited last\nmonth by General Sherman, I believe with a view to its fortification.)\n8. Condemning Burrard Inlet for the above reasons, I conclude that the ferminus\nshould be in Vancouver Island, which may be reached in three ways :\u2014\n1st. By steam ferry carrying a train from Burrard Inlet to JSTanaimo.\n2nd. By bridging Seymour Narrows.\n3rd. By steam ferry carrying a trainjfrom Estero Basin (Frederic Arm) to Otter\nCove.\n9. The train once landed on Vancouver Island, can, I understand, be carried without\nmuch difficulty either to Bsquimalt o'r to Quatsino, Sound, or perhaps to Barclay\nSound,-where Uchucklesit Harbour forms an admirable port.\n10. The first method of crossing\"the trait,that of a steam ferry from Burrard Inlet\ntoNanaimo has three objections,\u20141st. The drawbacks above mentioned,to navigating\nthe First Narrows and to going alongside a wharf in English Bay ; 2nd. The difficulty and certain frequent detention in mid-channel owing to fog; 3rd. The heavy\nsea with north-westerly and south-easterly gales which would be at least inconvenient fjr the conveyance of a train across the i trait of Georgia. Another, and J\nthink a cardinal objection, to the route\nby the course of the Fraser Eiver and|Bur- \nrard Inlet is its passing within six or eight miles of United States Territory, and its\nconsequent liability to destruction when most wanted in time of war.\n11. The second method that of a line of railway across Valde? Island without water\nconveyance would require very expensive bridging. Valdes is not one island as\nshewn on the Admiralty Chart, but consists of three or four islands.\nThe main difficulty, of course, exists in bridging Seymour Narrows, a distance of\n2,575 feet, in two spans of respectively 1,200 and 1,350 feet. To execute this work the\nmiddle pier has to be erected on a rock, said to be eighteen feet under water at low\ntide, with a velocity of tide over it of from five to eight knots. This would be a\nwork of vast magnitude and expense, even if it be practicable, to place a foundation\non the rock which, I doubt, as there is hardly any slack tide. Nor must it be for-\n;otten that bridging Seymour Narrows would, as regards\nanre\nps,\nobstruct the\nonly practicable channel between Vancouver Island and the Main. This alone\nshould, in my opinion, preclude its attempt.\n11. The third method, and the one I recommend, that of ferrying a train from\nEsteio Basin to Otter Cove, is, in my opinion, not only feasible but perfectly simple.\nI have carefully examined this route and find\u2014\n1st. That Otter Cove is well adapted for a pile dock terminus for the steam]ferry.\n2nd. That the head of Frederick Arm, at the entrance to Estero Basin, is also\nwell adapted for a pilo dock terminus.\n3rd. That the channel between the two is easy of navigation, being nearly\nstraight, free from dangers, smooth as glass, sheltered from all winds, and having\nvery little tidal stream.\n13. The tide in this,the Nodales Channel,is noted on the chart as running from two\nto three knots, but I think it is much less.\nI spent five hours in this channel during what should have beon the strength of\nthe tide, the day before the full moon, and found the tide scarcely perceptible.\nThe distance for steam ferry between the two ports is thirteen miles of still,\nclear navigation, and I consider it may, with proper signals, be safely traversed in\na fog.\n14. In advocating the route by Frederick Arm, it will be observed that I am\nassuming that the railway can be brought to that point.\nThis assumption is borne out by Mr. Fleming's report of 1877, in which he]states\nit io be \"a feasible scheme, but one exacting a heavy expenditure,\" which expenditure would, I suppose, be in part compensated by the route No. 6, from Yellow\nHead Pass io the head of Bute Inlet, being estimated at two million dollars less than\nthat by the Lower Fraser (No. 2) to Burrard Inlet.\n15. From conversation with Mr. Marcus Smith (the principal officer of the survey,\nnext to the Engineer-in-Chief) I am given to understand that the Rocky Mountains\ncan be crossed at a comparatively low level, and that the line can be carried through a\nfar less mountainous district by avoiding Yellow Head Pass altogether, and selecting\na route by Lesser Slave Lake and Pine Eiver Pass, and thence in a more or less\ndirect line to Bute Inlet. Should this prove correct, it will be an additional reason\nfor ending the main land route at Frederick Arm rather than at Burrard Inlet,\nomitting, as I do, all consideration of taking water conveyance from the head of\nBute Inlet on account of its length and tortuous passages, which would be impracticable in foggy weather.\n16. Having thus come to the conclusion that the line should pass by Frederick\nArm, and that the train should be conveyed by steam ferry through Nodales Channel, to Otter Cove, the extension to one of the good ports of Vancouver Island\nremains to be considered.\n17. In future years, I imagine that for the sake of more direct through ocean\ntraffic, a line will be extended to Quatsino Sound, by bridging Quatsino Narrows, and\nthence on to a terminus at Winter Harbour.\n18. But for present wants it seems that the line should be continued from Otter\nCove past Bayne's Sound and Nanaimo to Esquimalt, there to make the ocean terminus.   This port is easy and safe of approach at all times; its dock (to take the \nlargest ships) has been commenced, and there is reason to think that the line coming from the principal collieries and iron districts on Yancouver Island, ought to pay\nitself in great part by the conveyance of minerals to Esquimalt for shipment. Not\nonly for trade, but for the supply of coal to Her Majesfy's Squadron at Esquimalt, a\nline of rail from Nanaimo would be advantageous, as the possession of San Juan\nmight enable the United States, in case of war, to cut off our supply from the mines\nby Sea.\n19. Assuming, therefore, -that a line of rail between Esquirn.alt and Nanaimo\nwill be constructed, not only for the reasons above detailed, but because its construction appears to have been virtually promised by the Dominion Government,\nin accordance with Lord Carnarvon's suggestion (a large portion of the rails are actually lying at Esquimalt), the chief difficulty connected with the Vancouver part\nof the thiough line will be overcome, for I understand that the extension of the line\nfrom Nanaimo to Otter Cove pre>ents comparatively few difficulties.\n20. It will be observed that I have omitted consideration of a terminus in\nHowe Sound. This is because the same objections in respect to difficulties %of navigation to sea through Haro Strait, apply to Howe Sound as to Burrard Inlet, and\nwith greater force. The route to Howe Sound is also, I observe, estimated to cost\nsix million dollars more than that to Bute Inlet.\n21. Finally, whilst submitting the foregoing remarks in accordance with their\nLordship's instructions to mo. of the 2.>rd August 1876,1 beg to express much diffidence in respect to such as are not strictly within the scope of the Naval Service.\nViewing the shortness of my stay in British Columbia waters, this Report cannot\npretend to deserve much weight; but it has, I submit, one merit, that of coming from\n?n officer who, from his position, must be totally disconnected from all local interests.\nI have, &c,\n(Signed) A. De HOESEY,\nRear Admiral and Commander-in-Chief.\nThe Secretary\nTo the Admiralty.\ni\nThe Earl of Carnarvon to the Earl of Dufferin.\nDowning Street,\n1st December, lSW.\nMy Lord, \u2014-With reference to your Lordship's despatch, No. 115, of the 19th of\nApril last, and to my reply, No. 159, of the 23rd of May, I have the honor to\ntransmit to your Lordship, for communication to your Government, a copy of a\ndespatch from Rear-Admiral De Horsey, dated at Esquimalt the 9th of October, and\naddressed to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, enclosing a Report by\nCommander Hanmer, of H.M.S. \"Daring,\" of an examination of the channels and\napproaches of the River Skeena in British Columbia, made by him in reference to the\nquestion of the selection of a terminus on the Pacific coast for the Canadian Pacific\nRailway.\nIt is unnecessary for me to send you Commander Hanmer's Report, or the plans\nwhich accompanied it, as Admiral De Horsey appears- already to have forwarded\nthese papers to you direct; but I have sent copies to Mr. Sandford Fleming, who is\nnow in this country, for his information.\nI have, &c,\n(Signed) CARNARYON.\nGovernor General\nThe Right Honorable\nThe Earl of Dufferin, K.P., G.C.M.G., K.C.B.\n-m^^--- Rear-Admiral de Horsey to the Admiralty.\nI Shah \" at Esquimalt,\n9th October, 187?.\nSir,\u2014With reference to the directions of the Lords Commissioners of the\nAdmiralty, contained in your letter No. 86 of the 19th May last (received 14th\nAugust), I have the honor to report that I send the | Daring,\" Commander Hanmer,\nto make a general examination of the channels and approaches of the River Skeena.\nFrom Commander Hanmer's report, and from such information as I have been\nable to obtain, I am of opinion that, whether in view of communication with the\ninhabited parts of British Columbia, or of through traffic across the Pacific, the\nvicinity of Skeena is totally unfit for the ocean terminus of the proposed Canadian'\nPacific Railway. The mere circumstance that the bars of the river are not navigable\nfor ocean steamers except at high water, is of itself condemnatory, in my opinion.\nAdded to this, are the difficulties of tortuous approaches on a very foggy and rainy\ncoast, and that the land injthe vicinity is reported to consist of mountains and swamps,\noffering little inducement to settlers.\nI beg to transmit herewith a copy of my orders to Commander Hanmei, and of\nhis report, accompanied by plans of the mouth of the Skeena and of Woodcock Land\ning\nThe lateness of the season and the almost constant rain caused a service of this\nkind (necessarily performed in open boats) to be somewhat arduous. I submit Commander Hanmer's execution of it for their Lordships' approval.\nI have forwarded a copy of this report and enclosures for the information of the\nGovernor General of Canada.\nI have, &c,\n(Signed) A/De HORSEY,\nRear Admiral and Commander-in-Chief.\nThe Earl of Carnarvon to the Earl of Dufferin.\nDowning Street, 3rd January, 18*78.\nMy Lord,\u2014With reference to my despatch No. 350 of the 17th December,\nenclosing a despatch from the naval Commander-in-Chief on the Pacific Station,\nreporting his views witb respect to the question of the site for the terminus of the\nPacific Railway, I have the honor to transmit to you a copy of a letter received from\nMr. Sandford Fleming relating to this subject.\nA copy of Mr. Sandford Fleming's letter has been referred to the Board of\nAdmiralty, who have been requested to furnish a reply to the queries which he has\nput on certain points.\nI h^-ve, &c,\n(Signed) CARlNAJIVON.\nMr. Sandford Fleming to Mr. Herbert.\nCanadian Agency, 31 Queen Victoria Street, B.C.,\nLondon, 26th December, 1877.\nSir,-\u2014I beg to afeknowledge the receipts of Admiral De Horsey's despatches of\ndates 9th and 26th October, on the subject of a site for a terminus on the Pacific\nCoast for the Canadian Pacific Railway, both despatches having by the direction of\nthe Earl of Carnarvon been recently transmitted to me for perusal.\nAs requested by you, I now return the plans of the mouth of the River Skeena.\nwhich accompanied Admiral de Horsey's despatch of the 9th October.\nr I have carefully read\" these important documents, and I find that the River\nSkeena is objected to on account of difficulties of approach from sea and climafic\ncauses incidental to a high latitude. In considering these objections, I have thought\nit possible that the Canadian Government, before completely rejecting all idea of a\nnorthern terminus, may desire*to obtain some further information. I deem it my\nduly, therefore, ^in torderdthat\\lelays may be avoided, to suggest that the following\nenquiries be made :\u2014\n1. If the^nautical examinations instituted by the Admiralty, have been extended\nto Metlab'Catlah, Port Simpson, or other points on the coast, beyond the immediate\nmouth of the River Skeena, with the view of ascertaining how far any of them may\nbe eligible for the purposes of a terminus.\n2. If the Admiralty is in possession of data respecting the prevalence of rains,\nwinds, fogs, &c, on the coast referred to, which would admit of a comparison being\nmade between it and well-known places in nearly corresponding latitude on the coast\nof Europe or elsewhere. Take for example the coast of British Columbia, between\nlatitudes 54 and 55, embracing Dixon Entrance, Portland Inlet and River Skeena, as\ncompared with the coast of Great Britain, between latitudes 55 and 56, embracing\nthe north channel and the Forth and River Clyde.\nI have,, &c.,\n(Signed) SANDFORD FLEMING,\nRobert G.

PACIFIC RAILWAY ROUTE\nBRITISH  COLUMBIA,    lit\nTo The Hon. Senators and Members of the Bouse of Com\nmons:\nAs the important question of Pacific Railway Route iu British\nColumbia is likely to occupy the attention of Parliament, I have\nthought it advisable to prepare a sketch map of that Province, shewing\nthe different Routes that are likely to4)e considered, and the position of\nthe most prominent places mentioned in the several Reports issued\nfrom the Public Works Department on the subject.\nThe map is devoid of Topography and other detail, in order that\nthe relative position of the different Routes may strike the eye at a\nglance,\n1! trust it may be found of some use, and cause a saving of time to\nthose who consider the subject worthy of study.\nIt will be found on refeiring to the last Report of 1.-78, submitted\nto the Minister of Public Works April 26th of that year, that the\nquestion of Route narrowed itself down to a choice of two, one terminating at Esquimalt or Vancouver's Island, and the other at Burrard\nInlet, provided it was not thought advisable to make further surveys of\na northern line through the Peace River Oountrv to Fort Simpson ; and\nMr. Fleming after reviewing the two Routes, comes to this conclusion : \u2014\n\" Upon carefully viewing the engineering features of each, route, and weighing\nevery commercial consideration, I am forced to the conclusion that, if these alone\nare to govern a sejection, if a decision cannot lie postponed until further examinations he made, if .the construction of the Railway must he at once proceeded\nwith, the line to Vancouver Island should, for the present, he rejected, and that\nthe Government should select the route hy the Rivers Thompson, and Fraser to\nBurrard Inlet.''\nIn accordance with this recommendation, made after eight years\nof survey, conducted by most able engineers, at a cost, in the aggregate,\nof nearly three millions of dollars, I am informed that the late Government, by Order in Council, decided to adopt the Fraser River Route,\n-mss-J terminating at Burrard Inlet, and called for tenders for a section 125\nmiles in length, from Yale to Savana Ferry.\nI presume, after mature consideration, they found that the cost of\nsurveys that would be required to place the Northern Route in a position\nto make a comparison of distance,  grades,  and   cost  witn   the   Fraser\nRiver Route, would be  so enormous, and   the   chances  of   finding  a\npracticable line so remote, that it was thought unadvisable to prosecute\nthem, although Mr. Fleming stated in his report:\u2014\n\" If, therefore, this northern line is to be seriously considered, it is indispen-\nsahle that a thorough survey he made of it. With our present knowledge, it will\nbe unwise to adopt it as the route for the Railway and to determine on proceeding\nwith construction, without obtaining full and complete information regarding it.\nMy own opinion is in favor of gaining information, and if the Government\nentertain this view, I beg leave to suggest that during the pres-'nt year a continu-\n. ous exploration be made from Port Simpson, eastwards, to a point of junction with\nthe located line in the neighborhood of Lake Winnepegoosis.\"\nMy own impression is that the Government adopted a wise course\nin abandoning further surveys in that northern country, and in refusing to\nentertain the advice of Mr.-Marcus Smith to commence work on a\nRoute, information about which was so meagre, and which led to a\nterminus, the disadvantages of which, as against Burrard Inlet, increased when connected with a point nearly 300 miles north of Yellow\nHead Pass.\nFrom explorations I have myself made in the cou' try west of the'\nRocky Mountains for the Local Government of British Columbia, and\nthrough which a line to reach Fort Simpson must pass, I am convinced\nthat many seasons must be spent in surveys before an intelligent comparison can be made with other routes, and, I believe, with a verv poor\nchance of ultimately obtaining a practicable line.\nThe -arguments in favor of the adoption of the Fraser River\nRoute, with Burrard Inlet as the terminus, and which led to a thorough\nlocation survey of that line being made, have turned out to be unmis\ntakaoly correct, as the facts and figures in the report of Mr. Sandford\nFleming of 1878 prove.\nThe plans and profiles shew a saving in distance of 300 miles over\nthe Bute Inlet Route; grades greatly superior, as will be seen by\nreferring to the map, two summits on the Bute Inlet Route having to\nbe crossed at an altitude of 3,505 ft. and 3,610 ft., both within a,\nfew feet as  high  as the   Rocky Mountain   summit;  the  amount  of curvature on the line is slightly in favor of the Fraser River Route, and\nthe cost of construction $20,000,000 less, with the addition ol a fifteen\nmile ferry.\nThe facility for carrying on the work of construction on that Route,\nas compared with Bute Inlet Route, is so great that it is estimated that\na deduction of at least 12 per ce-ut. should be made on the cost of all\nworks on this Route below formation leveL\nBy no other route can the Canadian Pacific Railway be expected'\nto draw traffic from Puget Sound,. Washington, or Oregon. Territory, or\nto divide with California the Touiists' travel, which is a large source of\nrevenue to the American lines.\nIn reference to the Harbor of Burrard Inlet, at which the line, as-\nadopted by the late Government, terminates, there appears to be a*\ngreat misconception in some quarters as tofts extent and. capabilities,\nand althtxigh the prefe ence has been given to it by a large majority of\nthe best naval authorities-, I see, in some newspapers, that Esqui.malt is\nreferred to as the best Harbor on the eoast north of San Francisco. I\nhave consequently prepared a sketch shewing the relative sizes of\"\nEsqnimalt and Burrard Inlet Harbors.\nBy referring to the map it will be seea that Burrard Inlet is, in.\nsuperficial area, twenty-five times the size of Esquimalt, with g'>od\nanchorage almost all war it, and could give a dockage of about fifteen\nmiles at a light cost, by bringing the line of Railway along the south\nshore of the Inlet from Port Moody to Coal Harbor ; in fact if we are\never to have a terminus on our coast rJhat is to command a commerce\nsuch ai we have a rigir to expect, it cannot be done at Esquimalt, for\nthere is no room.\nSome objections have also been made 1o the navigation to reach\nBurrard Inlet and Bute Inletr and Mr. Marcus Smith states in his\nreport of laso year : \" A list is before me of over sixty marine disasters-\nthat have occurred in these waters within a few years.\"\nThe following is an extract on the question of the navigation to\nBurrard Inlet sent me by Mr. Hugh Nelson, formerly M.P. for New\nWestminster, one of the members of the Moody Milling Co., Burrard\nInlet. A perusal of it will shew that the navigation to that Inlet wilL\ncompare favorably with any port in.the world. mmmmmmm\nMr. Nelson should  be a good authority on this subject, having\nresided at Burrard Inlet for the last fifteen years,  and been directly\ninterested in its shipping :\nMoodyyille, February 7th, 1879.\nMy Dear Dewuney,\u2014I am just in receipt of yours of the 8th January, and am\nsorry to say, in reply, that I am unable to send you full list of vessels that have\nvisited Burrard Inlet for cargoes of lumber tor foreign ports. I have tried a\nnumber of times to get the vessels sent away bv the Hastings Mill Co., and they\nhave either not kept a record or are not inclined to be communicative, and until\nthe time of (Jlarkson's appointment to the Customs here, no record was kept by\nthis department. I do, however, send you a list of all the vessels that have\nvisited our own mill up to the present date, with their registered tonnage. For\nthe first few years the tonnage is closely approximate, as we only kept a list of the\nnames of the vessels and the amount ot lumber taken by them, and as there were\nonly a few vessels prior to 1868, I include, in the number and tonnage for th&t\nyear, not only what properly belongs to it, but also those of the preceding three\nyears:\u2014\nVessels   21,000 Registered Tons.\n\u00ab          15.000 \"\n1868...\n...36\n1869\t\n22\n1870\t\n... 14\n1871....\n... 19\n1872\t\n... 17\n1873 ...\nf>0\n1874\t\n... 18\n1875....\n99\n1876\t\n22\n1877\t\n... 29\n1878\t\n... 25\nO\n10,000\n12,000\n9.000\n16.000\n13,500\n15,600\n17,000\n19,500\n19.655\n3,463\n250 Ships. 171.718 Reg. Tons.\nMaking in all 250 ships with an average registered tonnage of about 687 tons.\nIn addition to these, there have been, of course, a large number of coasting\nschooners, steamers, &c., &c. Out ot this large number of ships the only vessel\nthat was lost in British Columbia waters was the barque \" Rosalia,\" in 1868, and\nshe was cast adrift while in tow of the steamer -Isabel,\" without time having\nbeen given her to set a sail, and was consequently blown ashore on Discovery\nIsland. The\" only vessel lost on voyage to the mill, in British Columbia waters,\nwas the barque \" Lunalillo,' in Royal Roads, off Esquimalt Harbor, blown ashore\nfrom her achorage almost at the same spot as. the Htidson's Bay barque \" Lady\nLamson\" went ashore, after being wrecked on Bcragg's Rocks, at entrance to\nEsquimalt Harbor. The only oth*r vessel leaving our mill that received\ndamages necessitating the discharge of any portion of her cargo was the barque\n\" Ruby,1' that also went'ashore in Royal Roads, and had to be taken into Esquimalt, a portion of her cargo discharged, and receive repairs. Not a single vessel\nof any tonnage ever received damage either coming in through the narrows or\ngoing out, necessitating repairs to the extent of one hundred dollars, and yet these\nnarrows are represented as the great bug-bear.\nBefore the next mail, I will try again to get a list from the Hastings people,\nand if successful will forward it to you, but failing success, I suppose it would be\nfair to assume that a like number of ships have visited their mill, making in all\n5i'0 ships, say, in a period of ten years, witii an average registered tonnage of\nnearly 700 tons each, and only two ships lost on their outward voyage in British\n\u2022Columbia waters, viz- \" Rosalia \" and \u00ab Cornelius,\" A claim has been put forward that Burrard Inlet is nRt an Ocean harbor. I\nthink such a statement as the foregoing will prove the untruthfulness of this\nslander.\n(Signed) H. NELSON.\nAnother advantage to the Fraser Route is that it would be an all\nrail route, and no Ferries to cause inconvenience to traffic.\nThe principal argurnents against the adoption of the Burrard Inlet\nRoute are the following :\u20141st, That it runs for some few miles in close\nproximity to the American Boundary, and that aline could be extended\nfrom a point on ours to Holmes7 Harbor, Pu\u00a3,et Sound, a distance of\nabout 60 miles, aud thus assist the Americans to build up a port and\nvirtually take our terminus from us.\nI think thaf. objection is easily answered. It undoubtedly lies\nwith us whether we allow a connection to be made. Our line\nruns on the north bank of Fraser River, and a bridge of an enormously\nexpensive character, and one that should not interfere with navigation\nof ships drawing 12 feet of water, would have to be constructed before\na junction eould be made with us. No obstruction should be placed in\nthe river that would prevent the passage of Her Majesty's gun-boats,\nwhich can navigate very near the point south of which connection must\nbe made by any line reaching a terminus in American territory.\nIn the year I808 the Hudson Bay Company's ship \" Otter,\" of\nabout 400 tons and drawing 12 feet of water, reached that point, and the\nmark still exists on the bluff made by the Captain on that memorable\ntrip.\nBy inspection of the map, the position of Holmes' Harbor .can be\nseen, and it will be evident that without a canal cut through a neck of\nland, the distaice from the ocean to reach it will not be much less\nthan to Burrard Inlet, but I have the best authority for stating that a\ncanal is impracticable, and was never seriously contemplated by any\none, and 1 fear our Acting Engineer-in-Chief must have b^en hoaxed by\nsome interested individual, as he appears to attach much importance to\nit. Some enterprising Americans did, at three different points on\nPusret Sound, lav off bogus town sites, and endeavored to sell lots at\nwhat they called the Northern Pacific Terminus. One was laid\noff at Holmes' Hai'bor, and to the uninformed, the scheme of cutting a\ncanal looked very feasible on the map, but the whole thing was nothing\nbut a swindling operation, got up for the purpose of taking in the\npublic. I myself would* not object to see a connection made with the railway system of Washington and Oregon Territories. The outcry has\nalways been on this side of the Dominion that there would be a want\nof local traffic on the Pacific Railway. This connection would greatly\nassist us in that particular, for I contend that the advantages of our\nroute would be such as to command a large amount of the transcontinental traffic of the adjoining territories of the United States, even if\nthe Northern Pacific was constructed.\nBut there are very strong reasons for believing that the Northern\nPacific will not be extended in a continuous line to the Pacific. The\nbarrenness of the country west of the point to which the last contract\nis let, the difficulties of the work as it approaches the Pacific, the high\nsummits to be crossed, necessitating very heavy grades, the construction\nof a line from Ogden to Portland, on the Columbia, by the Union-\nPacific, which will secure the transcontinental traffic that the Northern\nPacific expected to get, are among a few of the obstacles in its way.\nThere are other arguments which should not be overlooked in-\nfavour of our line\u2014Customs Regulations, Bonding Fees,and other complications consequent on passing through a foreign country\u2014and the\nlast and not least, the advantage we have in distance on our line, it\nbeing 400 miles in our favour irom the Pacific to Lake Superior. This-\nalone should give us almost a monopoly of the traffic.\n2nd. The military aspect. This objection needs but a passing\nremark. Naval and military authorities are almost unanimous in\nconsidering it of slight importance, for they contend that \"the country\nthat holds naval superiority in the Straits of Fuca will control the\ncommerce.\"    There can be no doubt about that: and unless we have it\n' r\nwe can no  more do  business at Esquimalt than we   can at Burrard\nInlet.\nSince writing ths above, I have noticed in the New Westminster\nPacific Herald a very able article on this subject, and append it.\nTrusting you will find the maps and these notes of service,\nI remain,\nYour obedient servant,\nE. DEWDNEY.. Taking, first, the leading idea of all the Island contributors to the\ndiscussion, viz., that Esquimalt must be the terminus, in order, as they\nargue, to give the Canadian Pacific a chance to compete successfully\nwith American transcontinental lines. Now, we think it may be stated\nas a proposition which will admit of no dispute, that the shortest line,\nin these go-ahead days, will naturally have the best chance in any such\ncompetition, provided that line does not possess any serious counterbalancing disadvantage, such as great cost in constructing or heavy\nexpense in operating. And it may also be taken for granted that th$\nline which can be most cheaply maintained and operated will have a\ngreat deal in its favour. Taking the question of distance first, we turn\nto Mr. Fleming's latest report, and find this:\u2014\nLet us assume, for the sake of the argument, that a railway is completed and\nin operation to both points, Burrard Inlet and Esquimalt, and a person at Esquimalt desires to tiavel to'Ottawa. He has the option of crossing by steamer, 90\nmiles, to Burrard Inlet, and then using the railway, or of taking the train at\nEsquimalt and proceeding on his journey from that point. In the latter case\nhe would, taking the most favourable view, have to travel some 150 mileg\nfarther; or, if the line were carried through by Pine River Pass, fully 20\u00a9 miles\nmore than by way of Burrard Inlet.\nIt is evident that even were the wide channels at the Valdes Islands bridged,\nthe Railway carried to Esquimalt would present no advantage in time or cost to\nan ordinary traveller. If passengers from Esquimalt could secure no benefit\nfrom the extension of the Railway to that place, it is certain that there would be\na loss sustained by carrying freight by the longer route.\nThis, coming from the Chief Engineer, must be acknowledged to\nbe exceedingly strons testimony in favor of the Fraser Route, in the\nmatter of distance, proving, as it does, that by that route, passengers\nand freight could most speedily perform the journey. Now, considering\nthe question of cost, we turn again to the same report, and find this :\u2014\nThe cost of extending the Railway to Esquimalt would greatly exceed that\nof taking it to Burrard Inlet; there are no sufficient data to form a proper estimate of the cost. But even by leaving a gap near Valdes Islands of fifteen\nmiles, and substituting a ferry for the enormously costly bridging at that locality,\nthe excess would probably reach $L5.000,000or $20,000,000. The cost of maintenance would be great in proportion, and the annual losses on working the\n\u00abxtra mileage would, under the peculiar circumstances, be serious.\nTurning now to ^Ir. H. J. Cambie's carefully studied report, we\nfind the cost of building the line to English Bay, Burrard Inlet\n\u2022estimated at $32,000,000, while the cost of the line to Esquimalt is\n\u00abet down at 4$52,OO0,000, without what Mr. Fleming calls the \" enormously costly bridging\" of the Straits. We will, therefore, be well\n\u25a0within the mark in \u2022estimating the cost of an all rail line to Esquimalt 8\n(and no other would be worth a button in competition with foreign\nlinas) at just double that of a similar line to Burrard Inlet, involving,\nof course, a double charge for interest. In the same report, the cost of\nmaintaining the line to Esquimalt is calculated to exceed the same\ncharge on the line to Burrard Inlet, by $693,000 a year, including an\nallowance for a ferry, or, say $600,000 a year for an all rail route.\nHere, then, we have the line to Esquimalt saddled with an extra cost\nof about $l,tf 00,000 a year, for interest and maintenance; and for\nwhat? In order that passengers and freight may have to travel 150 or\n200 miles farther, and arrive at their destination one or two days\nlater! And, as Mr. Cambie justly observes, rates for through traffic\nwill be governed by competing lines, and not by mileage. So far, then,\neven looking at the line wholly with respect to the through traffic\u2014\nleaving out of sight the unification of the Dominion, and the colonization of the country, for which purposes the Fraser Route is admittedly\nunequalled\u2014we find an enormous balance of advantages in favor of the\nline terminating at Burrard Inlet. Into what is called the military\naspect of the question, we have not time to enter now. It can easily\nbe shown, however, that even here the Fraser Route will compare well\nwith its rival. Suffice it, for the present, to say that we have the\nauthority of General Sir Selby Smythe for treating the military\nobjections to th\u00ab- Fraser Route lightly } and, even if it were otherwise,\nwe have the authority of a thousand years of glorious memories for\nsaying that the British Lion is little likely to go skulking up among\nnorthern iceburgs, with his tail between his legs, scared by the shadowy\npossibility of future danger.\nTable of Distances from Summit of Rocky   Mountains  bo  Pacifie\nOcean Harbors.\nComparative\ncost.\nEraser    River   Route   to   Port   Moody,   Burrard Inlet, 489 miles $31,000,000>\n\"                     Extended to Coal Harbor 501 \"\nBute    Inlet    Route     to Esquimalt, including 15 miles\nferry from Fredeiick Arm to Otter Cove...'... .?&\u00bb \u2022<        52,000,000>   "}], "Extent": [{"attrs": {"property": "dcterms:extent", "classmap": "dpla:SourceResource", "ns": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/extent", "lang": "en"}, "label": "Extent", "iri": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/extent", "explain": "A Dublin Core Terms Property; The size or duration of the resource.", "value": "8 pages : map (folded) ; 22 cm"}], "Language": [{"attrs": {"property": "dcterms:language", "classmap": "dpla:SourceResource", "ns": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/language", "lang": "en"}, "label": "Language", "iri": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/language", "explain": "A Dublin Core Terms Property; A language of the resource.; Recommended best practice is to use a controlled vocabulary such as RFC 4646 [RFC4646].", "value": "English"}], "SortDate": [{"attrs": {"classmap": "dpla:SourceResource", "ns": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date", "lang": "en"}, "label": "SortDate", "iri": "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/date", "explain": "A Dublin Core Elements Property; A point or period of time associated with an event in the lifecycle of the resource.; Date may be used to express temporal information at any level of granularity.
